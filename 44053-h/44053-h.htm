<h2>INTRODUCTION BY THE EDITOR.</h2>


<p>The preparation of this volume for the press,
whilst it has necessarily entailed considerable
labour, has happily been attended with little
difficulty. None of these sermons were prepared
for the pulpit with any idea of publication, and
only a few of them, which need not be specified,
should be taken as finished compositions. Their
author, however, never allowed himself to think
superficially or to write carelessly. His MSS. are
easily read, and are in such a state as to leave
almost nothing to be done in the way of revision.</p>

<p>Many other sermons equal to these in power
and interest might have been included, if space
had served. I ought, perhaps, to say that the
selection has been determined by a wish to place
before the reader, in the order of a series, Mr.
Bailhache&rsquo;s thoughts on Christian Doctrine, Faith,
Duty, Privilege, Experience, and Hope. I trust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>viii]</a></span>
that the collection, as it stands, will give as comprehensive
an idea, as any posthumous publication
<em>could</em> give, of the character and style of a ministry
to which, under God, many souls&mdash;some in heaven,
and some still on earth&mdash;owe their truest spiritual
light and their best spiritual strength.</p>

<p>It must have been a privilege of no ordinary
value to listen Sabbath after Sabbath to preaching
such as this. No one could read, as I have had
to read, the whole mass of sermons entrusted to
me, without perceiving that he who wrote and
spoke them was &ldquo;a workman that needed not to be
ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.&rdquo; He
was penetrated to the very centre of his being
with a sense of the grandeur of the Bible as a
Divine Revelation, and of the glory of the Gospel
as a Divine remedy for the sin and sorrow of the
world. He had his own way of developing
religious truth, and of applying it to the mind, the
conscience, and the heart. He preserved his
individuality of thought and of method in every
part of every discourse. But he was no theological
speculatist. With all needful fearlessness in his
thinking and reading, his constant endeavour was
to ascertain &ldquo;the mind of the Spirit,&rdquo; and to
present <em>that</em>, in its enlightening and sanctifying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>ix]</a></span>
power, to his hearers in all their manifold spiritual
conditions. He was familiar with the forms of
scepticism prevalent in our time, and with the
reasonings which give to them more or less of
plausibility. &ldquo;The riddle of the world&rdquo; had its
saddening aspects for him, as it has for all earnest
souls. But the anxieties which spring from such
sources found in his mind an all-sufficient solace
in the beautiful adaptations and the splendid
triumphs of the truth as it is in Jesus. He could
see clearly enough that, by the Gospel, God was
filling the world&rsquo;s darkness with light, and turning
its curse into a blessing. Science might advance,
and in its advance might seem to set itself
against Biblical facts, and against the principles
founded upon them; but he was all along calmly and
intelligently assured that Science rightly so called,
and Revelation rightly interpreted, so far from
meeting in antagonism, must meet in cordial and
comely agreement, and take their place side by
side for the higher instruction of mankind. He
did not preach on these matters controversially,
but contented himself with the quiet announcement,
on all appropriate occasions, of the results
of his own studies; and those results were always
on the side of an implicit faith in Evangelical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>x]</a></span>
Christianity. One of the most marked characteristics
of his ministry was the uninterrupted
and profound reverence he paid to what he
believed, on honest and mature investigation, to
be the Divine authority of Scripture teaching.
He knew, of course, that a conscientious and enlightened
criticism has its work to do upon the
Book; but his comprehensive and careful reading
only strengthened his conviction that such criticism,
so far from invalidating its authority, must
render the nature of that authority increasingly
transparent, and its basis increasingly firm. Thus
he could draw forth from the Book the teaching
contained in it, and could present it to the reverent
faith of his congregation, without misgiving.
His ministry was eminently evangelical,
in the broadest and best sense of the word. It
was this all-pervading quality which gave to it its
special beauty and impressiveness. He wanted
to be wise, and to make his people wise, <em>up</em> to
what is written; above that he did not attempt
to soar.</p>

<p>Mr. Bailhache was an able Biblical Expositor.
I find amongst the papers before me, expositions
of the Decalogue, the First Psalm, the Lord&rsquo;s
Prayer, the thirteenth chapter of First Corinthians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xi]</a></span>
the Messages to the Seven Churches, and the Epistles
to the Galatians and the Philippians. These
comprise eighty discourses, and many of them are
so good that they ought not to remain in seclusion.
Possibly some channel of publicity may yet be
found for them.</p>

<p>The estimate in which Mr. Bailhache was held
as a Christian teacher by those best fitted to
judge, is fitly expressed in the following extract
from the Address which was presented to him by
the Congregation at Islington, on his retirement
from the pastorate there in the autumn of 1870:&mdash;&ldquo;During
a period of six years and a half, you
have ministered to us in holy things, and, as the
servant of the Lord Jesus, you have sought our
highest spiritual good. In all your ministerial
work in our midst, you have so impressed us with
the conviction of your entire devotedness to our
interests, and to the exaltation and glory of Christ,
that our minds have been the more easily constrained
to give heed to your instructions, and we
have the more deeply felt the force of your
influence and your example. The thought has
often occurred to us (and it has been often expressed),
that if we were not becoming better
Christians&mdash;more conformed to the image of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xii]</a></span>
Christ&mdash;our shame was the greater, considering
how constantly you have been the faithful and
able exponent of the mind of the Spirit, and with
what freshness, variety, and power, you have been
enabled to set before us things new and old out of
the treasury of the Lord&rsquo;s word. Nor have you
ever permitted us to feel that you occupied a region
remote from ourselves, or that the isolation of the
study and of your official character, made you self-absorbed
or unsympathetic. The very contrary of
this has been our happy experience. With an
almost surprising power of appropriation, you
have made our doubts and difficulties, our hopes
and fears, our joys and sorrows, all your own, and,
with a whole-hearted sympathy that has entered
into all the experiences of the Christian life, you
have, in the pulpit and in the class, and in the more
private opportunities of the family and of friendship,
been made eminently useful in the communication
of help and strength. To not a few your
ministrations have been made the savour of life
unto life, who will be your crown and rejoicing one
day, since through your word they have been
reconciled to God by Jesus Christ. We magnify
the grace of God in you, and none the less when
we declare that your life and labours in our midst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xiii]</a></span>
have placed us under lasting obligations of gratitude
and love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I regret that I have not space for a few pages
of pithy, condensed jottings extracted from the
Author&rsquo;s &ldquo;Diary,&rdquo; and written by him during
hours of private devotion. They would testify, in
common with every other part of the volume, to
the atmosphere of piety in which our beloved
friend habitually lived. In social life, he was playful
and jocose; and many who have thought that
they knew him well, knew him almost exclusively
as he was in such moods as these. He was however
emphatically a man who &ldquo;walked with God.&rdquo;
Many others knew him only in connection with his
official work, and gave to him their unstinted
admiration for his plodding, almost pertinacious
industry. He had &ldquo;a mind to work,&rdquo; but he
sanctified and ennobled all his work by prayer. I
have often had, as, no doubt, many more have had,
the privilege of his society in the lone hours of the
night, when he could talk with the unreserved
frankness of a confiding friend; and I never left
him after such hallowed times as these without
feeling that I had been drawn nearer to him, and
through him, nearer to the Saviour, by the modest,
holy, Christian beauty of his spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xiv]</a></span>
Alas, that so comely and benignant a life should
have closed so early! He died at forty-eight years
of age. We have no right, nor have we any disposition,
to repine; but we cannot refrain from
mourning.</p>

<p>He began life well, sacrificing fair interests as
a member of the legal profession in Jersey, with
the Island Bar in view, and was soon preparing
for the Christian ministry at Stepney College. His
preaching was attractive, and at the termination of
his academic course, he became the pastor of the
influential church at South Parade Chapel, Leeds.
Four years later, he removed to Watford, and
from thence, in 1864, to Cross Street, Islington,
where his ministry may be said to have approached,
if it did not actually reach, its maturity. In
1870 he relinquished the pastorate for Secretarial
work at the Baptist Mission House, into which he
threw all the steady, quenchless enthusiasm of his
nature, and upon which the blessing of God conspicuously
rested. Discharging his duties with a
fidelity and a skill which were as effective as they
were modest, he was equally beloved by the Missionaries
abroad, and by his colleagues and the constituencies
at home; and he had the satisfaction of
knowing that, notwithstanding many difficulties,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xv]</a></span>
he was contributing in various ways to the advancement
of the great enterprize. The toil and anxiety
entailed upon him were onerous in the extreme,
and after a time it became obvious to his friends
that his multifarious exertions were undermining
his strength. He went to the Baptist Union
meetings in Leeds in the October of 1878, when he
ought to have been taking repose; and, though
seriously ill, he there preached what proved to be
his last Sermon, in the chapel of his first pastorate&mdash;the
Sermon on &ldquo;Immortality&rdquo; in this volume&mdash;and
read his last paper, on &ldquo;Our Missionary
Principles and Motives.&rdquo; It is remarkable that he
should thus have finished his public course in the
town of his first ministerial settlement, and that
he should have there spoken his last public words
on behalf of that great department of Christian
work which had engaged his best thoughts and
his warmest sympathies for many years, and to his
holy zeal for which it may be truly said that he
sacrificed his life. At those Leeds meetings, he
was &ldquo;already within the shadow of death,&rdquo; and
returned home to sink gradually but surely beneath
the distressing malady which took him to heaven
on the 13th of the following December.</p>

<p>To his widowed companion and helpmeet, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xvi]</a></span>
faithful affection he prized as his most precious
earthly treasure&mdash;to his children and kindred, who
so fondly loved him, and so deeply revere his
memory&mdash;to the churches which he so wisely and
so zealously served in the work of the Gospel&mdash;to
the Missionary Society in the sacred interests of
which he lived and died&mdash;and to the numberless
personal friends to whom he was so dear, and who
will ever thank God that they were permitted to
enjoy his genial confidence and sympathy&mdash;these
productions of his brain and heart are dedicated,
with the grateful assurance that, through them,
he, being dead, will yet continue to speak, and,
speaking thus, will still be the helper of many in
&ldquo;the way everlasting.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><span class="smlfont">I.</span><br />
<i>SALVATION.</i></h2>

<p class="theme">&ldquo;The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared
to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and
worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly,
in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the
glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus
Christ; who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us
from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar people,
zealous of good works.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Titus</span> ii. 11-14.</p>


<p>Briefly stated, the consequences of the Fall were
these&mdash;that man became unholy in point of character,
and guilty in point of law. The first
covenant God made with man was a covenant
of law, and the two &ldquo;trees&rdquo; shadowed forth, the
one the condition, the other the benefit, of such
a covenant. &ldquo;The tree of the knowledge of good
and evil&rdquo; points to obedience as the condition; and
&ldquo;the tree of life&rdquo; points to life, in its fullest and
most spiritual sense, as the benefit. Man disobeyed.
He failed to fulfil the condition, and thus
he lost the blessing. Henceforth, if there is to be
any blessing for him, it must come on some other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
ground, and from some higher source. Having
forfeited all hope from law, his only possible hope
must come, if it come at all, from mercy.</p>

<p>We thus perceive that when the great salvation
wrought by Christ is announced to us, we have to
do at the outset with what on God&rsquo;s part is</p>

<p>1. An act of pure sovereignty. Condemnation
was the righteous award of a just law to a creature
who had broken it, and who could not plead any
admissible excuse for his sin. The law might,
therefore, have been allowed to take its course,
thus receiving honour before the whole intelligent
universe. Only one Will in the universe was free
to interfere; the will of the Lawgiver and Creator
Himself. Interference on His part, however,
could not be under the pressure of legal obligation,
but must be in the exercise of a sovereign right.
Hence, the key-note of the gospel is &ldquo;the <em>Grace</em>
of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. An act of boundless love. It is obvious
that salvation cannot have proceeded from any
other motive in the Divine Mind. &ldquo;God <em>so loved</em>
the world, that He gave His only begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish,
but have everlasting life.&rdquo; The Bible has no other
solution of the origin of salvation to offer than this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
Now, that which proceeds from sovereignty and
love on the part of God must absolutely preclude
all claim or thought of merit on the part
of man. Merit leaves no room, no occasion for
grace. Grace begins where merit ends, if grace
be given at all.&mdash;What, then, <em>is</em> the &ldquo;great salvation&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Man, being unholy and guilty, needed a salvation
which would include his justification or his
forgiveness, and one which would culminate in his
sanctification by the restoration to him of his lost
spiritual power. In other words, he needed a deliverance
from the curse of sin, and also from sin
itself.</p>

<p>This deliverance, man cannot find within his
own nature. He cannot save himself from the
curse of sin; for inasmuch as the law righteously
demanded a perfect and constant obedience, he
could never blot out the guilt of former sins by acts
of obedience at a later period of life. Moreover,
such later acts of a perfect obedience are impossible
to him, for holiness does not proceed from a
sinful nature. &ldquo;Who can bring a clean thing out
of an unclean?&rdquo; Men do not &ldquo;gather grapes
from thorns, or figs from thistles.&rdquo; Man is as
depraved and as weak as he is guilty. Self-salvation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
is impossible; salvation is of the Lord alone.
The gospel is the announcement of the fact that
God saves, and of the method in which the great
work of salvation is done by Him.</p>

<p>I. The Word of God, both in the Old and in the
New Testament, proclaims a dispensation of Divine
mercy. So unexpected and so cheering is this
proclamation that it has given the gospel the
name it bears. It is emphatically &ldquo;good news&rdquo;&mdash;good
news from God to man. This good news
announces that the first deliverance which man
requires is provided for. God remits the penalty
of sin. But how?</p>

<p>He does this in such a way that, so far from
weakening law, or invalidating the condemnation
of sin, He shows more clearly than ever, how holy
is the law, and how just the condemnation. Hence,
though this forgiveness is an act of pure mercy, it
is mercy exercised in a righteous way through the
wonderful sacrifice of Christ. This was the meaning
of the promise that accompanied the curse;
and so clear was it that it was apprehended in the
first sacrifices men ever offered. The Jewish sacrifices
shadowed it forth. The Scriptures teach this
method of Divine forgiveness in the plainest terms.
I quote two or three passages in proof: Rom. iii.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
23-26; John i. 29; 1 John ii. 1, 2; 1 Peter ii. 24;
Isaiah liii. 4-6.</p>

<p>This is Scripture, and we must not dare to trifle
with it. These declarations can have but one
meaning. Christ has suffered in our stead the
penalty we had all deserved, that we might receive,
for His sake, that eternal life and blessedness which
<em>He only had deserved</em>. On this point all the types
and teachings of both Testaments speak with one
voice.</p>

<p>There are, no doubt, in this substitution of the
innocent for the guilty, some difficulties for human
reason. But <em>we</em> have to do with the Bible. It
meets conscience; and reason must bend in submission
before a grace the deeper meaning of which
it does not see. Observe, however, that according
to the Scripture representation, the substitution
was divinely appointed, and the Substitute Himself
was a willing victim. We accept the doctrine,
(1) Partly in virtue of human need. Conscience
points to the necessity of a satisfaction. (2)
Partly in virtue of the peace and the joy to which
faith in the doctrine gives rise.&mdash;&ldquo;Scripture always
lays stress upon the Saviour&rsquo;s humiliation and
bitter sufferings. We are not said to be redeemed
by His incarnation, by His birth, by His miracles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
by His doctrine, not even by His agony in the
garden, though all these were necessary to the
ransom; but by His blood.&rdquo; On this ground
of the Atonement, the first part of salvation&mdash;forgiveness&mdash;is
secured.</p>

<p>II. Man needs also to be redeemed from sin.
This need, like the former, he is unable to meet
of himself, but God meets it on his behalf.
How? By putting into the heart a fertile germ
of holiness.</p>

<p>Freedom from condemnation and regeneration
are indissolubly connected together in God&rsquo;s idea
of salvation, and He achieves both by the work of
Christ His Son. This redemption from the love,
and consequently from the power of sin, is accomplished
by Him on a principle which is divinely
simple and efficacious; a principle which lies at the
root of the theory of evangelical sanctification.
This principle is the love which He excites <em>in</em> us
by the manifestation of His own love <em>to</em> us. Thus
the Apostle John writes: &ldquo;Whosoever abideth in
Him sinneth not; whosoever sinneth hath not seen
Him, neither known Him&rdquo; (1 John iii. 6). &ldquo;He
that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love&rdquo;
(1 John iv. 8). To love God, and, under the constraining
influence of love, to serve Him, we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
need to know and to realise how great is the love
of God to us.</p>

<p>Now this Divine love has been revealed to the
world through the medium of that same Saviour,
who by His sacrificial death has opened up the
way for our pardon and our restoration to the
Divine favour. The Son of God came into the
world to reveal the heart of the Father. What
greater gift could God have bestowed than that
of His Divine Son? What greater proof of
love could He have exhibited than that which
this greatest of all possible gifts presents? &ldquo;God
<em>so</em> loved.&rdquo; And Christ has perfectly performed
His mission. His whole ministry was a declaration
of the Divine love. Of that love His
death on the cross was the sublimest expression.
We learn therefrom not only that God manifests
to us His mercy, <em>but also at what cost</em>. Our debt
must be paid; and as we are bankrupt, He pays it
on our behalf. And who is our Substitute? Not
a man, not an angel, not any creature; but the
Divine Son, &ldquo;by whom God made the worlds and
upholds them by the word of His power,&rdquo; &ldquo;who is
the brightness of the Father&rsquo;s glory and the express
image of His person&rdquo;&mdash;it was <em>He</em> who &ldquo;by Himself
purged our sins.&rdquo; Such is the love of God. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
cannot fathom it, for it is Divine; but in proportion
as we are enabled to &ldquo;know&rdquo; it, we say &ldquo;We
love Him because He first loved us;&rdquo; &ldquo;We are
bought with a price: we are not our own.&rdquo; And
we say our devout &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; when the chiefest
Apostle of mercy says to us: &ldquo;I beseech you,
therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that
ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable
service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This Divine love, however, wonderful as it is,
is offered to unsusceptible hearts. Hence the
necessity&mdash;hence also the gift&mdash;of the Holy Spirit,
through whom God strives with man. The Holy
Spirit is the gift of Christ; and He convinces the
world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment.
He takes of the things of Christ, and shows them
unto us.</p>

<p>See, then, the completeness of the Divine plan
of salvation. To undeserving hearts God offers
His love in Christ; to unsusceptible hearts He
explains and commends it by His Spirit.</p>

<p>III. The only remaining question is as to our
own part in the great plan of mercy. Because
we are intelligent and moral creatures, God does
not save us without our own concurrence. To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
every one who desires to receive this twofold gift&mdash;the
gift of pardon and of sanctification&mdash;a certain
disposition is necessary. That disposition is
in the Scriptures called &ldquo;faith.&rdquo; Faith is the
divinely-appointed condition of salvation. The
terms are simple, but they are indispensable.
Scripture, in every part, recognises and imposes
them. From the earliest times they have been
complied with, as in the sacrifices of Abel, Noah,
and Abraham. It was this same principle of
faith that gave validity to the worship under the
Mosaic dispensation. So the Lord Jesus Christ,
who healed men&rsquo;s physical diseases as types of
the diseases of the soul, always demanded faith
as the condition of His working. As it was with
Christ, so it was with His apostles. Thus Paul
said to the Philippian jailer, &ldquo;Believe on the
Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.&rdquo; All
this shows to us that whilst, on the one hand, we
are saved by grace; on the other, we have no participation
in the grace which saves, except by the
exercise of our own faith in the Saviour.</p>

<p>What is this faith? It may be considered in
its principle, and in its application.</p>

<p>In its principle, it is a general conviction that
the Bible is the Word of God, and that what He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
says therein should receive our assent; or, in
other words, should be accepted by us as <em>true</em>.
In its application, it is the belief of God&rsquo;s Word
as it respects <em>ourselves</em>. It is this which Paul
commends to the Philippian jailer. When a man,
under the burden of his sin, says, &ldquo;I am lost; I
cannot save myself; save me, Lord!&rdquo; we have an
illustration of this applied faith&mdash;a sense of personal
misery, a sense of personal helplessness,
a sense of a Saviour willing to save him personally,
and a direct appeal to that Saviour for
salvation. From the moment of such a prayer,
there is not a single promise of Scripture that
such a man may not make his own. A promised
pardon, a promised Spirit, a promised heaven&mdash;all
are his! The essence of the faith is in the
conviction which expresses itself thus: &ldquo;Jesus
Christ is not only able and willing to be the
Saviour of all men, but He is my Saviour.&rdquo;
Such a faith brings Christ and the soul together
in precisely those relations in which He is the
Saviour, and in which the soul is saved.</p>

<p>But how is this faith obtained? Must not God
give it? Yes. So Paul, writing to the Philippians,
tells them it was &ldquo;given&rdquo; to them &ldquo;to
believe in Christ.&rdquo; Must we, then, listlessly wait
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
until it comes to us? No. Paul again says to
these same Philippians, &ldquo;Work out your own
salvation with fear and trembling.&rdquo; The reconciliation
of these two truths into one theory may
be difficult, but in practice it is easy enough.
<em>We recognise them both when we ask for faith.</em> For
to ask is to recognise our need of that for which
we ask; it is also to recognise the fact that we do
not possess it of ourselves; and it is also to seek
and to act. Ask, then, for faith, and God will
say: &ldquo;Wilt thou be made whole?&rdquo; Will you&mdash;not
as a vague desire, but as the most earnest
determination of your heart and will? Ask for
faith; God will grant it. Ask largely; you cannot
ask too much. And even if you sigh over the
weakness of desire, press the old and never-failing
prayer: &ldquo;Lord, I believe; help Thou my
unbelief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith saves, and grace saves. This is scarcely
a contradiction in terms, and certainly it is no
contradiction in principle. Faith is the instrument;
grace is the primary and efficacious power.
Faith is the channel; grace is the stream. Faith
touches the hem of the Saviour&rsquo;s garment; grace
is the virtue that passes forth from Him in response
to the touch. Christ reaches down from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
heaven; faith reaches up from earth; each hand
grasps the other&mdash;the one in weakness, the other
in power&mdash;and salvation is in the grasp. Take&mdash;oh,
take that pierced hand! Amen.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="smlfont">II.</span><br />
<i>PROPITIATION.</i></h2>

<p class="theme">&ldquo;He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but
also for the sins of the whole world.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">1 John</span> ii. 2.</p>


<p>It is easier to attack than to defend. An objection
may be stated in a single sentence which
shall require many pages for an adequate reply.
Those who reject Christianity generally adopt this
method, but I know not why they should be
allowed to monopolise it. Why should not believers,
instead of simply proving that there is a
God, and that the Bible is His Word, insist upon
positive proof from their opponents that there is
no God, and that the Bible is nothing more than
a human book? Why should we not impose upon
them the more difficult task of defending their
position, by attacking it with all earnestness at
every point? For Christian defence, we have
need to be both really and consciously very strong
in the truth. On the other hand, to be an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
unbeliever, a man can do without either knowledge
or goodness. He has only to ply you with his
eternal &ldquo;<em>Why?</em>&rdquo; <em>Why</em>, because the universe
exists, must it have ever been <em>created</em>? <em>Why</em> may
it not have always existed? <em>Why</em> are we bound
to accept the teaching of the Bible? <em>Why</em> was it
necessary that Christ should suffer to expiate our
sins? <em>Why</em> did Christ come so late in the history
of the world? <em>Why</em> are there no miracles now?
<em>Why? Why? Why?</em>&mdash;</p>

<p>As Christians, however, we take the position
open to us, whether of attack or defence. We do
so because the salvation of our adversaries is dear
to us, and because we are so sure that the course
they adopt injures, not ourselves, but them. We
bring to them a priceless treasure&mdash;salvation
through, and from, the crucified Christ. If they
hinder us, the loss is theirs.</p>

<p>On the present occasion we deal with one of the
questions often propounded: &ldquo;Why was it necessary
that Christ should die for our sins, in order that
we may be saved?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;How can the sufferings
of the innocent atone for the sins of the guilty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To make our answer more clear, we begin by
saying: &ldquo;We do not know.&rdquo; Why should we
insist&mdash;why should any one insist&mdash;upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
understanding the &ldquo;<em>why</em>&rdquo; of this arrangement? Why
should not every one be content to know the <em>fact</em>?
If the reason of the fact were obvious, we should,
of course, gladly accept it; but if it be hidden
from us, whilst the fact itself is disclosed, why
should we complain? We cannot fully understand
the Divine purposes. We can only guess.
Even angels study, and wonder, and adore, but
do not fully know. Let it be observed that the
real question here is not exactly as unbelievers
put it. Thus: I do not know how the rays of the
sun enlighten my eyes, nor how my enlightened
eyes transmit ideas to my mind. Does it follow
that the sun does not enlighten, or that my mind
does not receive impressions through what I see?
The imperative question is, not, &ldquo;How is the
thing done?&rdquo; but, &ldquo;<em>Is</em> it done?&rdquo;&mdash;not as to the
<em>reason</em> of the fact, but the <em>reality</em> of it. So in the
matter before us. It is surely enough for us to
show that redemption through the sacrifice of
Christ, like the sun, comes from God, and that it
gives light, life, and fruit. This being done,
nothing more can be reasonably asked.</p>

<p>To know whether this doctrine of redemption
is God&rsquo;s truth, it is sufficient to know whether the
Bible is God&rsquo;s Word. And here we ask, What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
will you do with ancient prophecies and their
fulfilment?&mdash;with confirmations of Bible history
which are continually accumulating?&mdash;with the
conspicuous excellence of the moral teaching and
influence which the Bible supplies?&mdash;with the
sublimity of Christ&rsquo;s character?&mdash;with the
miracles He wrought?&mdash;with the marvellous
effects of Christianity upon the world, notwithstanding
the strongest inducements, in human
prejudice, to its rejection? Settle such questions
as these according to the admitted laws of evidence,
and then there will be no reason to contend
as to the &ldquo;why&rdquo; and the &ldquo;how&rdquo; of redemption.</p>

<p>Such, however, is not the method which the
unbeliever pursues. He turns away from the
Record as a source of instruction. It is hard to
convince a man who begins by closing his ears
with his own pride. To whatever study a man
addresses himself, he will never advance in it in
<em>spite</em> of himself. His progress will be proportioned,
among other things, to the amount of
honest effort he makes to learn. That is, he must
feel the fact and the disadvantage of his own
ignorance. Who could study mathematics by
beginning at the outset to dispute its axioms?
Just so with Christian truth. Put aside prejudice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
and pride. Do not take it for granted that you
have light enough in your mind, at starting,
to pronounce upon the truth or the falsity,
the reasonableness or the unreasonableness, of
the doctrine of salvation through the cross of
Christ. Listen attentively. Look for more
light, and receive it when it comes. We do not
say: &ldquo;Believe before you have read;&rdquo; but
we do say: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t contradict before you have
read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have already said that we are not obliged to
<em>explain</em> the philosophy of the redemption which
is taught in the Scriptures. Let me now say that
that redemption is itself the best solution of the
great difficulty which is felt by the believer and
the unbeliever alike. It is this: Conscience tells
us that God is just; the heart tells us that He is
good;&mdash;how then can a God whose justice and
goodness are equal, <i>i.e.</i>, both of them infinite,
escape from the position in which sinners have
placed Him? I put the difficulty in this bold form
in order that it may be the more distinctly apprehended.
We have sinned, and a just God must
punish. We sigh after happiness, and a good
God&mdash;a God who is infinitely kind&mdash;may be expected
to bestow happiness upon us. But how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
can God deal with us in both these ways at one
and the same time?</p>

<p>We know instinctively, of course, that there is
no real dilemma to God Himself; but those who
reject the atonement of Christ are bound to deal
with what presents itself as an inevitable dilemma
to <em>them</em>.</p>

<p>The unbeliever says: &ldquo;God is too good to
punish.&rdquo; What then becomes of His justice,
since conscience testifies that we are sinners, that
sin deserves punishment, that vice and virtue are
not one, that God cannot deal in the same way
with both without encouraging the vice which
needs to be suppressed, and discouraging the
virtue which needs to be upheld? Take away the
fear of punishment under the pretext that God is
good, and you deprive conscience of its meaning
and its power.</p>

<p>Shall it be said, then, that God will punish
every transgressor? Have the numberless generations
which have been upon the earth gone to
an inevitable doom? This conclusion is as hard
to admit as the other. The instincts of the heart
are against it.</p>

<p>No; men do not accept either conclusion to the
exclusion of the other. They say God will adopt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
a mean between His justice and His mercy so as
to bring them into harmony. But how? Here is
the crucial difficulty. Is it to be solved by the
principle of mutual concession?</p>

<p>Let me remind you, again, that the difficulty is
not created by God, but by man. In Him, justice
and mercy are really one: it is only to us that they
are seen to be two; and it is our sin which disturbs
and confuses our conception of their union with
each other. He might indeed annihilate us, and
so leave us no opportunity to complain. But our
whole moral and emotional nature repels with
horror the thought of such a termination to our
sin, as being unworthy of the God who has to
govern us. No! when we reflect seriously upon
the question, we cannot resist the feeling that God
must have some plan of rescuing us from the doom
we merit which shall give equal expression to His
justice and His mercy.</p>

<p>Men in general, alas! hold justice cheaply, and,
lowering the Divine standard of human character,
they easily persuade themselves that they may
enter heaven through the breach they have made
in the Divine attributes. They think that God is
indulgent, and will forgive, forgetting that indulgence
is weakness. God <em>will</em> forgive, but His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
forgiveness must stand on safe ground. It cannot
apply indiscriminately to all men. Men think
they have said all when they have said, &ldquo;God
will forgive.&rdquo; Such a forgiveness would aim a
blow at His justice. No matter; He will forgive!
Such a forgiveness is without motive&mdash;an effect
without a cause. No matter; He will forgive!
Such a forgiveness has its root in sentiment, not
in reason. It matters not; He will forgive! Such
a forgiveness imposes no obligation on the forgiver,
and encourages sin. Never mind; He will
forgive!</p>

<p>Surely this is the spiritual blindness which comes
from the perversion of the conscience and the
heart.</p>

<p>Some say, &ldquo;God forgives; but the condition is
that we turn away from sin and live a life of holiness.&rdquo;
There are many answers to this; but I
will only ask those who thus speak, &ldquo;Are you now
living in such a way as to have in your present
holiness, and on the ground of it, the assurance of
your pardon?&rdquo; That is a question which conscience
may be safely left to answer.</p>

<p>At this point Christianity comes professing to
reveal to us the Divine plan of salvation. It tells
us that God forgives for the sake of Jesus Christ,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
who is Himself, in His sacrifice, the gift of the
Father&rsquo;s love. A debt has been contracted; the
insolvent debtor presents in payment the money
which a friend has freely contributed for the purpose;
the creditor is satisfied. In this way goodness
and justice are reconciled. It is Divine love
which meets the claim of the Divine Righteousness.
The redeemed soul, redeemed by the blood of
Christ, is led to obedience by a love which responds
to the love which has redeemed him. This last
result none can dispute. Does it spring from
error? No; it is too pure, too blessed for that.
The redemption that produces it is a true principle
founded in the nature of God&mdash;sublime in its working&mdash;like
sap, inexplicable, but justified by the
beauty of its foliage and the goodliness of its
fruits.</p>

<p>Let us look a little more closely into this principle
of Propitiation. Suppose we were reading
the gospel for the first time, free from prejudice,
and from the deadening influence of habit; we
should be struck with the prominence everywhere
given in it to the death of Christ. Ask a Christian
child, or an aged saint, &ldquo;What did Christ come
on earth to do?&rdquo; The answer from each will be,
&ldquo;He came to die for us.&rdquo; The child finds his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
answer on the very surface of Scripture; the aged
man finds it in that same Scripture when he has
studied it to its very depths. The one quickly
learns that this death of Christ was often predicted
by Christ Himself, that it holds the most prominent
place in each of the four Gospels, that it is constantly
referred to in the Epistles, that it is the
text of all the preaching of the apostles, and that
it is symbolised in both the sacraments, for &ldquo;we
are buried by baptism into His death,&rdquo; and whenever
in the Supper we partake of the bread and
wine, we &ldquo;show forth His death till He come.&rdquo;
The mature Christian, in his turn, learns to look
upon the death of Christ as the centre and the
soul of all the great acts of the great work of our
redemption, which seem, whether they preceded or
followed, to have been done in direct view of it, and
in indissoluble connection with it. The incarnation
was designed to open up the way for it. &ldquo;Forasmuch
then as the children are partakers of flesh and
blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the
same; that through death He might destroy him
that had the power of death, that is, the devil.&rdquo;
The resurrection was intended to attest its meaning
and its value. For Christ was &ldquo;delivered for
our offences, and was raised again for our justification.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
The object of the ascension was to
secure the precious fruits of it. &ldquo;For He entered
in once into the holy place, having obtained
eternal redemption for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The remarkable thing in all this is that in the
gospel, the aim of which is to reveal eternal life,
the Prince of Life is always offered to us as dying
upon the cross. <em>Death in order to life!</em> What can
be the meaning and the bearing of a death which
God has placed in so exalted a position? We can
only get our answer from Scripture; and we can
only get it from Scripture as we read in the simple,
unsophisticated humility of mind and heart of
which Christ Himself and His apostles give us the
example.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Jesus Christ is the propitiation for our sins.</em>&rdquo;
We have sinned against God, and our sins have
been so many <em>offences</em> to Him; offences which must
be dealt with. Christ averts the penalty from us
by taking it to Himself. The Holy One consents
to suffer for the sake of the guilty. The apostle
who styles Christ as the &ldquo;Propitiation&rdquo; has said,
in a sentence immediately preceding: &ldquo;The blood
of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.&rdquo;
Almost numberless passages teach the same
doctrine. If we were engaged in an exercise of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
Biblical criticism, we should have to discuss each
of these passages minutely in its turn. But the
general idea we gather from them is definite and
clear. A ransom paid, our sins borne, the wrath
of God appeased, an offered sacrifice&mdash;all these
contain one idea: Jesus Christ freeing us from
the desert of our sin by Himself satisfying Divine
Justice on our behalf.</p>

<p>Hence the two great facts of our religious history.
We were under the condemnation of a holy
law. He who was &ldquo;the Life,&rdquo; <em>for our sake</em> endured
death that we who deserved death might have life
<em>for His sake</em>. And God is &ldquo;faithful and just to
forgive us our sins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To a simple-hearted Christian all this is clear.
Men may be scandalised at the exchange (as they
term it) between justice and sin, between life and
death; but Paul knows how to state the matter:
&ldquo;God hath made Him (Christ) to be sin for us,
who knew no sin, that we might be made the
righteousness of God in Him.&rdquo; Men may be indignant
(as they often profess to be) at the thought
of the innocent suffering for the guilty; but Peter
does not hesitate to say: &ldquo;Christ hath once
suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He
might bring us to God.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
What is it, moreover, that <em>connects</em> the teaching
of the Old Testament with that of the New? The
doctrine of sacrifice, as thus explained, is not
simply <em>attested</em> by Scripture: it is the <em>soul</em> of it; its
bond of unity. The death of Christ is <em>the</em> sacrifice
&ldquo;once offered in the end of the world,&rdquo; in which
all the sacrifices of the Old Testament find their
common destination; to which they correspond,
as the figure to the reality. The cross is the end,
the key, the meaning, the value of all of them.
Without this we cannot understand them. They
were types: the cross is the antitype. What they
<em>represented</em>, the cross <em>achieved</em>. The cross procured
the pardon which they proclaimed. And so the
cross has always been the symbol of the Christian
Church. The Jews understood it, and were scandalised;
the Greeks understood it, and sneered.</p>

<p>And now what ends does this sacrifice of Propitiation
serve? Mainly two, which are inclusive of
all the rest.</p>

<p>I. It is the fullest revelation of the Divine
character. Leaving aside all questions of abstract
and technical theology, we observe that it sets
before us, in one great act, the righteousness and
the mercy of God. The cross proclaims the pardon
for which infinite love solicits. <em>The heart of God</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
<em>yields to itself.</em> But how can this be? It is
because the pardon solicited by love is obtained by
a sacrifice which equally exhibits God&rsquo;s righteousness.
If we seek the universe through for the
greatest proof we can have of the love of God to
the sinner, we shall find it in the cross; for we
there see not only that God forgives, but also that
He is <em>so resolved</em> to forgive that, rather than that
the sinner shall be left to perish, the stroke of the
offended law shall fall on the willing head and
heart and life of &ldquo;His only begotten and well-beloved
Son.&rdquo; On the other hand, if we want to
know something of God&rsquo;s abhorrence of sin, we
shall find it in the cross; for we there see that, so
impossible is it for Him to allow it to go unpunished,
that He secures for it a Divine expiation in
the willing sacrifice of His Divine Son. &ldquo;Mercy
and truth are met together; righteousness and
peace have kissed each other.&rdquo; Most persons can
see in the cross a demonstration of Divine love;
in the light of Bible teaching, they may also see
in it a demonstration of Divine justice more marked
and telling than in a closed Eden, in the waters of
the Deluge, in the overthrow of the cities of the
plain, in the destruction of Jerusalem, or in the
punishment of the wicked in eternity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
II. If men are to be saved at all, they must
be saved <em>to holiness</em>; they must be sanctified as
well as forgiven. The result cannot be otherwise
for those who truly believe in the sacrifice of
Christ as thus explained. Holiness and love, the
two great elements of the character of God; these
are expressed in the cross, and they must be reproduced
in the character of those for whom the
cross does its appointed work. How can we
believe, as the cross teaches us to believe, in God&rsquo;s
hatred to sin, without feeling that we must hate it
also, and, hating it, must forsake it? And how
can we believe, as the cross teaches us to believe,
in the love which has obtained our salvation,
without giving our own love as a genuine, though
feeble, return? Let a man, struggling with the
sins which he condemns, but which he cannot
shake off, learn that the Son of God came into the
world to die for him; and he will find in that revelation
a strength for conflict with sin which he
never had before. Speak to him of the beauty
and dignity of the law, of the righteousness of
God&rsquo;s claims, of the penalties of transgression;
and, though his conscience may assent to all you
say, his heart will not yield. Can he refuse when
he sees Jesus on the cross, and knows what, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
him, that spectacle means? The cross is an argument
presented to his reason, his conscience, his
will, his heart, his whole being; nay, it is more
than an argument, it is an appeal; and the
response must be: &ldquo;We love Him because He
first loved us.&rdquo; &ldquo;The love of Christ constraineth
us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all,
then were all dead: and that He died for all, that
they which live should not henceforth live unto
themselves, but unto Him who died for them, and
rose again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now it only remains to be said that this
Propitiation is needed by all, that it is sufficient
for all, and that it is free to all. Let all receive it.</p>

<h2><span class="smlfont">III.</span><br />
<i>FAITH IN THE SAVIOUR.</i></h2>

<p class="theme">&ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be
saved.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Acts</span> xvi. 31.</p>


<p>A startling providential dispensation was one
of the means by which the spiritual nature of this
jailer was roused. Only one, effectual so far as it
went, but not complete in itself. It was preparatory
and auxiliary to the action of the Holy Spirit,
the instrument by which the Spirit did His special
work of convincing the man of sin. Thus it is
that outward events and circumstances are made
to co-operate with God in the conversion of a soul.
The way in which the Spirit works is a mystery,
akin to that in which one human mind acts upon
another. But the <em>means</em> of this spiritual action is
no mystery. We use speech, external appliances
of various kinds; the Divine Spirit does the same.
In the case of the jailer he employed the earthquake
together with the calm faith, the perfect serenity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
of the apostles at a moment which was to
himself a moment of terror, and which would also
have been a moment of terror to them had they
not been the Christians they were. A great joy;
a great sorrow, commotion, loss, alarm, the apparent
nearness of death; daily mercies, the &ldquo;means
of grace,&rdquo; the Word of God, the ministry of the
gospel&mdash;through all these the Spirit works. They
are powerless in themselves; they can only become
mighty as used by Him.</p>

<p>It is obvious at a glance that this man&rsquo;s spiritual
nature <em>was</em> roused. Spiritual realities burst in
upon his mind in all their awful momentousness.
His whole soul was suddenly concentrated in a
sense of his ruin. Hence the short, sharp question&mdash;the
question which sprung from an inward
agony&mdash;&ldquo;What must I do to be saved?&rdquo; That
question must be answered, if it can be&mdash;answered
on the instant! There is a tremendous depth of
meaning in it. It is as though a lightning flash
had in a moment illuminated the man&rsquo;s whole
spiritual condition, bringing out every feature of it
into startling distinctness. All the fears and the
aspirations of his immortal being are here; his
past life with all its sin, his remorse, his dread of
judgment, his terror in the presence of God&mdash;all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
are here; he feels himself to be a lost man. How
can he be saved?</p>

<p>In his question there is no hint of self-righteousness
or of self-confidence, or even of the remotest
hope in himself. He does not ask, like &ldquo;the young
man in the gospel,&rdquo; &ldquo;What good thing must I
do that I may inherit eternal life?&rdquo; The question
of the young man is leisurely; the question of the
jailer is hurried, under the feeling that there is
not a moment to be lost. Helpless and hopeless,
he wants but one thing, and that is to be &ldquo;saved.&rdquo;
Of course his &ldquo;What must I do?&rdquo; indicates that
he is willing and ready to comply with any possible
terms; yet it is not a question of conscious strength&mdash;it
is rather the question of despair.</p>

<p>Such a question shows that a great point&mdash;an
essential point&mdash;had been gained. The gospel is
a sovereign remedy designed and constructed to
meet a desperate case. Not only do they that are
whole stand in no need of a physician, but
wherever there lingers an idea of spiritual strength,
or a dream, of self-righteousness, the condition
necessary for the reception of such a salvation as
that which the gospel proclaims is entirely wanting.
Christ is an exclusive Saviour, and &ldquo;looking to
Him&rdquo; is an exclusive hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
&ldquo;What must I do to be saved?&rdquo; Clear, quick,
unhesitating, comes the answer of Paul: &ldquo;Believe
on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.&rdquo;
Both the question and the answer strike the point&mdash;the
centre of the soul&rsquo;s supreme need, and the
centre of the gospel message.</p>

<p>This answer of Paul&rsquo;s is not simply his own. It
is the answer of God to every man who wants to
know how he can be saved. It is the answer of
the whole Bible. It is the pre-eminently, distinctively
Christian answer. All revelation has
one great object&mdash;Jesus Christ, promised, announced,
expected, seen by faith beforehand; then
Jesus Christ actually come, His life told, His
mission developed, Himself presented to the world
as the one and only Name whereby men can be
saved;&mdash;always Jesus Christ. Patriarchs and
prophets, Moses and David, Christ Himself, His
apostles and disciples after Him, the whole Church&mdash;all
unite to say to the awakened soul: &ldquo;Believe
on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this answer, though not Paul&rsquo;s alone, is
nevertheless his in such a sense that an immense
weight belongs to it. What does Paul himself
understand by it? We know something of his
experience, and that will tell us the meaning of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
these words as spoken by him. He spake that
which he knew, and testified that which he had
seen. He felt that he could offer to the spiritual
need of every man that which had so fully met
his own.</p>

<p>Read Paul&rsquo;s life. Read his epistles. You see
at a glance what Christ was to <em>him</em>&mdash;a Redeemer.
And what to him was the very centre of Christian
truth? &ldquo;Christ crucified.&rdquo; He had been so
roused as to see clearly the relation between himself
and God. The true sense of sin had been
awakened within him. No man had made more
strenuous efforts to obtain justification by the
works of the law than he had; and no man had
more deeply realised his helplessness. How does
he describe the struggle? &ldquo;I had not known sin,
but by the law.... When the commandment
came, sin revived, and I died.... Sin, taking occasion
by the commandment, deceived me, and by
it slew me.... That which I do I allow not: for
what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that
do I.... I know that in me (that is, in my flesh)
there dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present
with me; but how to perform that which is good
I find not. For the good that I would I do not:
but the evil which I would not, that I do.... O
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me
from the body of this death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We all know how God arrested, overcame, and
subdued him, by showing him in that same &ldquo;Jesus
Christ our Lord&rdquo; the mystery of the Divine love.
God taught him that he must no longer expect
righteousness and eternal life to come from his own
works, to be wrought by his own strength. Eternal
life is the free gift of God. Look to the cross!
Listen to the Spirit! Learn in &ldquo;the folly of the
cross&rdquo; to adore the wisdom and the power of God&mdash;a
forgiveness that glorifies justice as well as
mercy; a forgiveness that kills sin as well as
removes its penalty; a salvation that harmonises
man with God as well as forgives him; a salvation
that implies a perfect holiness, the motive being
love, and the effectual power being that of the Holy
Spirit. Deep as his want had been, it was now
completely met by the revelation of the Saviour.
To that revelation his response was prompt, complete,
irrevocable. He says that it was as though
scales had fallen from his eyes, this disclosure of
the Divine plan of salvation to his mind. It was
full of light, full of mercy. The manifestation of
the risen Christ was the instrumentality which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
enlightened him. He saw straightway the nature
and purpose of &ldquo;the cross,&rdquo; the certainty of justification
through faith, the believer&rsquo;s completeness
in Christ. &ldquo;Who is he that condemneth? It is
Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who
is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh
intercession for us.&rdquo; &ldquo;There is now no condemnation
to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk
not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the
law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made
me free from the law of sin and death. For what
the law could not do, in that it was weak through
the flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled
in us who walk not after the flesh, but after
the Spirit.&rdquo; &ldquo;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by
the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a
living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is
your reasonable service. And be not conformed to
this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing
of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good,
and acceptable, and perfect will of God.&rdquo; The
natural result of these convictions in the apostle&rsquo;s
own case was his consecration to the Saviour.
Bought with a great price, he felt that he was no
longer his own, but that, in life and death, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
belonged to Him who had given Himself for him.
In Christ he had found peace for his conscience,
light for his mind, love for his heart. And what
was the secret of it all? Simply &ldquo;believing in the
Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This, then, was Paul&rsquo;s gospel to the jailer, and
there is no other gospel to-day. We know that
sin incurs condemnation&mdash;the displeasure of God.
The universal conscience gives testimony to that
fact. We know that man cannot, in his own
person, satisfy the claims of the Divine law. But
there comes down to us the old truth that Christ
is &ldquo;the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of
the world.&rdquo; He &ldquo;finished the work which His
Father gave Him to do,&rdquo; and the whole benefit of
that work is given to faith.</p>

<p>It is in the name of this perfect system of truth&mdash;which,
observe, is a perfect series of facts&mdash;consecrated
by the trial of ages, by the experience
of an incalculable number of souls in all times,
places, and conditions, and by the world&rsquo;s own
verdict on Christian character wherever it is found&mdash;that
we speak to you with a confidence equal to
that with which Paul spoke to the jailer. And let
me add that we so speak because we have made
the experience of it our own, and that it is as sure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
in our hearts as our very existence. Yes, a perfect
series of facts as well as a perfect system of truth.
Men sometimes object that we put before them
hard and abstruse systems of theology, and that
we condemn them for not believing things which
they cannot understand. There is no need to
do anything of the kind, and when it is done a
grave mistake is committed. I preach no &ldquo;abstractions&rdquo;
to you when I urge you to faith in
Christ for salvation. I deal with facts and their
deductions&mdash;deductions which are as inevitable as
the facts are real&mdash;deductions which follow the
facts as the shadow follows the substance. Deny
the deductions? You must first deny the facts.
The jailer, poor man, was no theologian, and Paul
did not perplex and mystify him. He placed the
person of Christ immediately before the soul.
Faith in a person; that is <em>first</em>&mdash;not faith in a
creed. A creed will follow; for there cannot be
faith without thought, and thought always strives
to formulate itself. But, blessed be God, millions
have been saved with next to no &ldquo;theology.&rdquo;
Having Christ for its object, and salvation for its
aim, faith reposes in the facts of His mission and
work; but as He is a living Christ, it emphatically
reposes in <em>Him</em>. This is the commonest form of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
the believer&rsquo;s experience. In our social life we
know what faith in a person means. We confide
in known goodness; and therefore we believe
words, promises, acts, and we do so because we
trust <em>him</em> from whom they come. This is the
last and most perfect stage of the faith men place
in one another, and it includes a confidence which
is not impaired by what, in the person who is
trusted, seems startling, unexpected, mysterious,
contradictory, inexplicable. Just so with the gospel.
It meets our needs by telling us what God has done
for us in Christ. We believe the record which fits
our want, and we put our trust in the Saviour.
Confiding in Him, we can accept such mysteries as
we may discern in His dealings, and faith in a
holy and loving Saviour is henceforth the true rest
of life, and the true foretaste of heaven.</p>

<p>Such being the nature of faith unto salvation,
we see how it contrasts (1) with indifference. Indifference
is commonly supposed to be a mental
state, in which a man neither believes nor disbelieves;
whereas it is really a state of spiritual
deadness. (2) With mere opinion, which is
nothing more than an inclination in favour of, or
against, a thing, and not an earnest practical conviction
about it. (3) With presumption, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
is a prepossession with no sufficient basis of
evidence.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, be said that, in this representation
of faith in Christ as the one all-comprehensive
condition of salvation, we have left no
room for penitence, holiness, devotedness. But
think again for a moment. Were not all these in
this man? Did not his conduct to the apostles
show, so far as the opportunity was given him,
the fruits of faith in the various ways of grateful
love? Faith is the starting-point; but when we
are told to &ldquo;believe in Christ&rdquo; an appeal is made
to us in response to which there is a whole career
to be filled up. Faith, like everything else in
life, has its beginning, and its development is progressive.
It means thought, and thought means
contrition, gratitude, and a glad and loving obedience.
It requires time, but we have eternity
before us. In some, the result of years is accomplished
in a day. Simple-hearted men generally
receive by a sort of intuition what others take a
long period to elaborate. The one thing essential
to all is that they be faithful to the light and the
love they have received.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; We do
not call you to a learned and critical study. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
life and teachings and redeeming work of the
Saviour are put before us with a simplicity that
brings them within the reach of a peasant or a
child. Attention, earnestness, sincerity, prayer,
will do all that is needed. Seek the faith that will
make Christ yours. Do you not already, under
the gracious influence of the Holy Spirit, feel your
need of Him? Oh, whilst mercy calls, and the
throne of grace is accessible, pray and yield!</p>

<h2><span class="smlfont">IV.</span><br />
<i>SINCERITY OF HEART NECESSARY
TO THE UNDERSTANDING
OF THE GOSPEL.</i></h2>

<p class="theme">&ldquo;If any man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine,
whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">John</span>
vii. 17.</p>


<p>The Jews, marvelling at Christ&rsquo;s teaching in the
temple, exclaim, &ldquo;How knoweth this man letters,
having never learned?&rdquo; They do not mean to ask
whether Christ is competent to teach, for they <em>see</em>
that he is so clearly enough; but they thus express
their astonishment at the authority and the ability
with which He deals with the Scriptures, considering
that He has never received the instruction
of the Schools.</p>

<p>In His reply, Jesus fully enters into the thought
of His questioners. That thought is this: &ldquo;In
order to teach, one must have been taught.&rdquo; He
intimates to them that He meets this requirement.
As though He had said: &ldquo;It is true that I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
not been in the schools of your Rabbis, but I have
been taught in a better school than theirs. He
who has given me my mission, has also given me
my message. So that my teaching does not
proceed originally from myself. I have only to
lay hold of my Father&rsquo;s thought, and then to
reproduce it faithfully to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But how is this to be verified? The answer to
this question is found in the text: &ldquo;If any man
will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine,
whether it be of God, or whether I speak of
myself.&rdquo; Christ&rsquo;s teaching, in its highest aim, is
a Divine method of sanctification. Whoever, then,
earnestly seeks to &ldquo;do the will of God&rdquo;&mdash;that is,
to be holy&mdash;will soon recognise the Divine adaptability
of the gospel to its end. The meaning of
the verse is the same as in chapter v. and verse 46:
&ldquo;For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed
me;&rdquo; and also in chapter iii. and verse 21:
&ldquo;He that doeth truth cometh to the light.&rdquo; On
the one hand, the holy sublimity of the gospel
flashes irresistibly on the soul that longs for holiness;
on the other hand, the soul, in its inability
to attain its ideal, seeks peace and strength at the
hands of the Saviour. Faith, therefore, is not the
result of a logical operation; it appears to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
soul as the best means of realising the satisfaction
of its deepest want&mdash;holiness. The word &ldquo;will&rdquo;
points to the loftiness of the aspiration and to the
earnestness of the effort.</p>

<p>Our Lord&rsquo;s words, then, mean this, that if any
man be supremely anxious to do the right, he will
find in Scripture sufficient proof of its divinity,
and, as a consequence, of its adaptability to the
soul&rsquo;s deepest need. Christ was dealing with men
who were disposed to cavil about His authority
and about the truth which He taught. These
men were acquainted with the Mosaic law, which
enjoined not only purity of life, but also purity of
heart. It was a law therefore which, if honestly
studied, must lead to those convictions which
would enable them to see the necessity and the
wisdom of the gospel which Christ was preaching.
And so He lays down the principle that sincerity
in regard to the <em>known</em> law of God determines the
real position of the mind <em>towards</em> God, and prepares
it for deeper and still deeper penetration into all
necessary spiritual knowledge. On the contrary,
he who is insincere, and does not practise what
he knows, but endeavours to evade it by sophistry,
blinds himself until even the brightest light can
be of no service to him. This was the case with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
majority of the Pharisees with whom Christ had
to do. This passage is therefore of the highest
practical importance, since it teaches that man&rsquo;s
capacity for spiritual knowledge is dependent upon
his inclination. If the will be opposed to God,
the understanding becomes clouded; if it be inclined
towards God, the ability to know increases.
That the inclination is the door to the intellect is
a fact universally recognised. It is expressed in
the proverb: &ldquo;None are so blind as those who
will not see.&rdquo; In every department of learning, a
man, in order to attainment, <em>must make up his mind
to it</em>. For good or ill, the will is a quickening
power.</p>

<p>It would be interesting and instructive to discuss
this question in connection with religious error,
both in and out of the professing Christian Church.
My present purpose, however, is a more simple
and elementary one&mdash;namely, to indicate the
bearing of the question upon man&rsquo;s reception of
the gospel for his salvation. I say, then, that
honesty, sincerity, integrity of heart is the required
and indispensable condition for perceiving and
feeling the divinity and suitability of the gospel;
and that even an ignorant man, if he be but sincere,
and devoutly anxious to know the will of God,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
that he may do it, may discover in the Bible those
traces of moral beauty and of Divine truth which
a learned but unconscientious man will almost
certainly fail to find therein. Sincerity of heart&mdash;this
is the wisest, most natural, and most comprehensive
means of access to the inner spirit of that
gospel which is the power of God unto salvation.
A few remarks in proof of this.</p>

<p>I. Suppose the gospel to be so manifestly filled
with the proofs of its divinity that all hearts,
even the most obdurate, could not refrain from
yielding to its claims. Suppose it to be <em>self-evidencing</em>,
in the same way and to the same extent,
as the sun is self-evidencing by its shining,
or fire by its known power to burn. In this case,
no moral or intellectual disposition would be
necessary in order to its reception. It could no
more be denied than the light of the sun, or the
consuming power of fire. But what, with such
a gospel, would be man&rsquo;s position? Forced to
assent to an imperious obligation, he would be, in
relation to the gospel and to the salvation provided
in it, nothing more than a machine, acting under
the impulse of an irresistible necessity. There
could, under these circumstances, be neither praise
nor blame attached to him. He could no longer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
be accounted a moral agent&mdash;could not be regarded
as free, inasmuch as it would not be possible for
him to choose error or evil without obvious and
startling folly. He could no longer be responsible,
because he would have to yield to a necessity.
There could be no free thought in his creed, no
free love in his heart, and consequently no virtue
in his life.</p>

<p>II. Since, then, some disposition is necessary in
order to a man&rsquo;s coming to the gospel, suppose
that God had imposed an <em>intellectual</em> qualification&mdash;such,
for instance, as is required for the learning
of art or of science, or for the understanding of any
difficult problem in philosophy. Observe what
in that case must follow. If, to discover the
truth necessary to salvation, a large measure of
natural genius or of accumulated knowledge be
required, we must consider as excluded from
salvation the immense majority of the human
race! Men cannot in any large numbers abandon
the common, legitimate, indispensable pursuits of
secular life in order to become students of theology.
Such an arrangement would shut out from heaven
all who have neither time, nor fortune, nor energy
of intellect sufficient to enable them to follow our
profounder investigations. The poor man for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
want of means, the sick man for want of strength,
the old man for want of time&mdash;all, being unable
to explore and to make their own the prescribed
science, would be lost! The fearfulness of the
consequences shows how false the supposed principle
must be.</p>

<p>III. Take another supposition; viz., that, in
order to a man&rsquo;s being convinced of the truth of
the gospel, he should be required to purify his
heart from all evil, so that with a clear moral
vision he should be able to see the beauties which
have been obscured by his sinful passions. Doubtless
this means of appreciating Christianity would
be efficacious, were it practicable. But it is not
so; for evidently the <em>knowledge</em> of the truth must
precede the <em>practice</em> of the truth. A creature without
wings might as well be told that he should go
to heaven on condition that he would fly thither!</p>

<p>IV. See now, not what <em>our</em> plans might be, but
what <em>God&rsquo;s</em> plan is. He does not influence man
so as to degrade him into a machine: He simply
and uniformly demands the worship and the service
of willing hearts. He does not require of him the
genius or the learning which is the privilege of
only a few. He does not ask in advance the
goodness which is impossible as a spontaneous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
production of his degenerate nature. He just
requires of all that which they can give, if they
will&mdash;viz., simple, devout honesty of purpose.
Christ&rsquo;s words are not, &ldquo;If any man <em>does</em>;&rdquo; but,
&ldquo;If any man will do&rdquo;&mdash;<em>desires</em> to do&mdash;is supremely
<em>anxious</em> to do&mdash;<em>wills</em> to do&mdash;&ldquo;the will of God he
shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God.&rdquo;
Who, then, has a right to complain? Who cannot
be sincere? Who is unable to set before himself
the purpose of living up to the light he has in
order that he may be in the surest position for
receiving more? Who will say, &ldquo;This condition
is too hard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Observe, then, how your case stands. Are you,
or are you not, anxious to please God in any way
which He may appoint and reveal to you? If you
are not, His gospel must be a sealed and unmeaning
book to you. Your mind is not open to the
faith which unites the soul to the Saviour. You
are altogether destitute of the motive which would
lead you to the cross. But if you are, what then?
You must see at once that you are sinners, that
you are guilty, and that you are hopeless. In the
light of these convictions, look at the gospel. It
tells you of the Divine Saviour who died for you
and who rose again, who paid your debt, who took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
to Himself your penalty, and who has therefore
done all that was necessary to set you free. To
meet your helplessness, He only asks for your
faith, and offers to you the quickening and guiding
and upholding influences of His Holy Spirit.</p>

<h2><span class="smlfont">V.</span><br />
<i>THE HUMBLE TAUGHT THE
LORD&rsquo;S WAY.</i></h2>

<p class="theme">&ldquo;The meek will He teach His way.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm</span> xxv. 9.</p>


<p>Instead of &ldquo;meek&rdquo; read &ldquo;humble,&rdquo; and then
connect the verse with the preceding, so as to
see who and what are the persons to whom the
Psalmist refers. The righteous Lord will teach
sinners His way; but the sinners, in order to be
thus divinely taught, must be humble.</p>

<p>Probably this text of Scripture does not seem
at first sight to be very promising to some of you.
If so, the reason probably is that one at least of
the subjects it brings to our notice is not a
favourite or inspiring one. Men are comparatively
little attracted by the more quiet and
passive virtues of life, and among these the virtue
of humility is one of the least popular. The
truth is that we are still under the influence of
Pagan notions about it. The philosophers of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
past never understood it. To them it was a mean
and despicable thing&mdash;the evidence of weakness
and poverty of soul, the necessary virtue of the
enslaved and the helpless. This notion exists
now. The world has far more respect for the
self-confident, the noisy, the bombastic, than for
the humble. Of course the world&rsquo;s ideas of
humility are at fault, and have need to be corrected.
We cannot enter upon that task now,
except incidentally and very partially. One thing
only let me say&mdash;namely, that Christianity has
transformed and ennobled the despised word by
giving us the thing itself. The life of Christ
comprises the perfection of humility as well as of
every other virtue. In Him we see that humility
makes no man contemptible. He was no less a
king because He was a servant. And the virtue
that was perfect in Him is one of the essential
qualities of the Christian character&mdash;one of the
essential elements of the Christian life, whether
in its high enjoyments or in its high achievements.</p>

<p>The words before us present this virtue of
humility under one special aspect. Man has
something to learn, and God has something to
teach; and humility is <em>teachableness</em>. Christianity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
demands of its disciples that disposition of heart
which is the indispensable condition of all learning
whatsoever. No more objection can be urged
against Christianity for this, than against any
art or science or philosophy which men seek to
acquire. All these might say to their disciples,
&ldquo;Unless you give up your prejudice, your conceit,
your self-will, your presumption, you have
no business here; we have nothing to teach you.&rdquo;
And so, &ldquo;poverty of spirit,&rdquo; as Christ intimates
in the &ldquo;Beatitudes,&rdquo; is the strait gate into &ldquo;the
kingdom of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is only as respects religion that this principle
is seriously misunderstood, and a little reflection
will show why it is that outside Christianity
humility is misapprehended. Humility is the
result of self-knowledge, and this cannot be obtained
until man has learned to know himself in
the light of God&rsquo;s wisdom and holiness. So long
as he compares himself with his fellow-creatures
around him, it may seem to him that there is no
necessity for such an element of character as this.
Nor is it in this way that the virtue is commended
and enforced. Whilst the standard of excellence
remains merely human, it is quite clear that a
man may say, &ldquo;I am as good as my neighbours;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
at least, I am no worse.&rdquo; But put before him a
holy God and a holy law! In this new light all
becomes changed. Apart from that revelation,
many flatter themselves that they have lived
respectably. They are not conscious of any
serious defection in the common, every-day duties
of life. Let the great revelation come to them,
and they must make wonderful self-discoveries.
How many forgotten sins are then brought to
mind! How many secret sins are then brought
to light! How many temptations have been
yielded to for convenience&rsquo; sake! How much
coldness and indifference towards the right, the
true, and the good! How much selfishness!
How much cowardice! How many meannesses!
How many secret and contemptible dishonesties!
What culpable ignorance of God! What rebellion
against His known will! Is not all this
enough to humble a man? Where is the man
amongst us who would not rather die than have
all his sins brought to light before his fellow-men?
Thus, to make us humble, God teaches us, first
of all, truly to know ourselves. This is that
&ldquo;conviction of sin&rdquo; which is wrought by His
Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>God teaches us this in His law, but chiefly by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
the life of Christ His Son. Who can remain
proud when he compares his own life with that?
Before men we may, perhaps, hold our own; but
before Him there is nothing left for us but self-abasement.</p>

<p>In presence of such a conviction as this, it is
vain for the world to flatter a man, for he has
learnt his own misery. He wants to know the
truth, for it is only the truth that can save. He
knows too much of himself to accept any teaching
that would exalt <em>man</em>, for he could not accept
that without dishonouring God. He wants a
frank, firm voice that will trouble him, and to
which his conscience will respond. The first
question for us is: Have we so learnt to know
ourselves, or do we obstinately shut our eyes
against God&rsquo;s light? Such a knowledge of sin
brings with it a sense of deserved condemnation.</p>

<p>And here God comes in to teach us humility in
another way. He shows us His love in Christ.
It is not possible that a sinner who has come to
the knowledge of himself should discover that he
is the object of a love on the part of God such as
that which the gospel reveals without being overwhelmed.
Show to man a God who judges and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
condemns, and the sinner must shrink from before
Him under the sense of a deserved doom; but show
to him a God who comes to him graciously, who
loves him, who has provided redemption for him,
and who is waiting to receive and to help him, and
all the pride of his heart at once breaks down.
The prodigal son was most humble when he received
his father&rsquo;s kiss of welcome. How can we be
proud when we know that God has loved us, and
that Christ has died for us? Unbelievers sometimes
call the Christian&rsquo;s faith presumption; we
know, on the contrary, that the feeling produced
is as unlike presumption as it can be. The very
faith which accepts the gospel has its root in
lowliness of mind. Pride would reject it. And
it is at the foot of the cross that humility grows.
If not there, then nowhere.</p>

<p>Thus we see that all our Christian life, in one
aspect of it, is a growth in humility. This beautiful
virtue affects our whole being, rescuing for
God all that has been usurped by sin.</p>

<p><em>Our reason must be humble.</em> We are living in an
age of criticism and discussion; and, both in the
Church and out of it, human thought is prone to
pride and self-sufficiency. There is work, of course,
for thought to do, and we must do it; for thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
is God&rsquo;s gift. But it can only be done aright as
it is done in humility. We must never touch
religious questions with profane hands. Let us
rather remember that all our researches into truth
should be conducted with a view the better to adore
and to obey. We should examine truth only with
a desire to perceive, acknowledge, and reverence it.
Our Lord teaches us that the gospel both enlightens
and blinds. &ldquo;For judgment I am come
into this world, that they who see not might see,
and that they who see might be made blind.&rdquo; The
first part of this great statement is easily understood;
it is the second which startles. But why
so? Is it not like Simeon&rsquo;s prediction that Christ
would be for the &ldquo;fall&rdquo; as well as for the &ldquo;rising&rdquo;
of many? Is it not like what Paul said of the
gospel, that it is a &ldquo;savour&rdquo; both of &ldquo;life unto
life&rdquo; and of &ldquo;death unto death&rdquo;? So long as the
gospel is not preached in a church or a house, all
is quiet&mdash;with the quietness of death! As soon as
it is preached, some accept it, and say that they
have passed from darkness to light; others reject
it, and are made angry by its teaching and its
claims. If these latter were quiet, we might
suppose the gospel to be without effect upon them;
but they show that, by hardening themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
against it, they are becoming blinder than ever.
Recall other words which point to the same result&mdash;words
spoken by our Lord: &ldquo;I thank Thee, O
Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou
hast hid these things from the wise and prudent,
and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so,
Father: for so it seemed good in Thy sight.&rdquo; This
should be a joyful truth to us, for Jesus had joy in
declaring it. Wherein is its worth? The &ldquo;things&rdquo;
of which He speaks are the doctrines of salvation.
&ldquo;The wise and prudent&rdquo; are self-satisfied men
who think that they can comprehend all religious
truth by their own reason alone. The &ldquo;babes&rdquo;
are humble souls, who, in the consciousness of
their ignorance and weakness, look to God for
wisdom. Thus Christ says that Divine teaching
is necessary for the understanding of gospel truth,
and this fact humility alone enables us to feel.
Man&rsquo;s intelligence can do many wonderful things,
but God Himself must come to our help if we are
ever to know the things that pertain to our salvation.
Our reason must bow to Him.</p>

<p><em>The heart must be humble.</em> We may profess
entire mental submission to God, and yet be under
the influence of pride. There is a humility which
is spurious as well as a humility which is real.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
It is possible, and not very uncommon, for a man
to cherish a false consciousness of merit even
in the disbelief and denial of merit! If a man is
proud who puts confidence in his self-righteousness,
so also is he who puts confidence in his
intellectual orthodoxy.</p>

<p><em>Our conduct must be humble.</em> This grace of
humility must not only dwell in the inner spirit,
but be manifested in our outer life. It is vain to
come to the cross with the offer of a bending reason,
a subdued will, and a broken heart, and then go
out into the world intent on the accomplishment
of our own purposes. If we are truly humble, we
shall be <em>seen</em> to be so in the way in which we
accept the teachings of events; in our reverent
waiting for the signs of the Divine will; in the
faithful, unreluctant fulfilment of the humblest
duties; in our resignation to, and our acquiescence
in, the trials and afflictive dispensations which
come upon us. We often see this grace in its
greatest beauty at the close of the most eminent
lives. God&rsquo;s most gifted men, as a rule, advance
in humility as they grow in experience. They are
like boughs that bend the lower the more fruit
they bear. Like John the Baptist, they say, &ldquo;He
must increase, but I must decrease.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
This, then, is the <em>disposition</em>, and to it God makes
a great <em>promise</em>. He will <em>teach His way</em> to the
humble. This applies</p>

<p><em>To our knowledge of Divine truth.</em> How uniformly
have God&rsquo;s truest witnesses upon earth consisted
of men conspicuous for their lowliness of
mind. It was to such that the Saviour was first announced
and that He first came. Such were the
people who listened to Him and accepted Him,
whilst the &ldquo;learned&rdquo; and the &ldquo;great&rdquo; rejected Him.
His apostles were humble men; and it has always
been by the humble that the strong and the proud
have, in the end, been vanquished. Every bright
page in the history of the Church is a commentary
on our text. To-day, in spite of the progress of
thought in our world, we, in regard to the matters
that belong to our spiritual life and salvation,
have to sit as disciples at the feet of the humble
men who themselves sat at the feet of the Divine
Teacher who said, &ldquo;Learn of me, for I am meek
and lowly of heart; and ye shall find rest unto
your souls.&rdquo; Our views of the truth as it is in
Jesus may be modified and corrected; yet the
pages of these same humble men are still the
standard of our faith and of our teaching. Religious
opinions change, not because we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
gone beyond Paul and Peter and John, but because
we understand them better. This is no plea, no
apology, for mental weakness. On the contrary,
pride is rather the characteristic of mental weakness
and of ignorance than of mental strength and
enlightenment. We may search, but we must
remember that we always depend upon God for
light. In religion the condition of the heart is
the condition of knowledge. Proud, haughty, self-sufficient
Saul of Tarsus had to be humbled
before he could become Paul the Believer and the
Apostle.</p>

<p><em>To the every-day dispensations of life.</em> In this
world we are the subjects of God&rsquo;s discipline, and
that discipline is for the most part mysterious.
The course of events with us is often varied. We
are subjected to vicissitudes of every kind&mdash;vicissitudes
of thought, of impression, of feeling, and
of experience. We are troubled in life, in heart,
in the cultivation of Christian excellence, in the
maintenance of life&rsquo;s relationships, in the performance
of duty. Whilst we try to bear in mind
the glorious issues to which we are destined, we
are often perplexed in our endeavours to ascertain
how the discipline we are undergoing tends towards
their realisation. We are puzzled by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
prevalence of wickedness, by the disappointment of
hopes, the apparent futility of many of our prayers;
and we say, &ldquo;I am blind, and the way in which I
am walking is unknown to me.&rdquo; Humility will
help us to think that God has <em>His own way</em> among
all these perplexities of ours, though we are unable
to trace it. &ldquo;All things work together for good
to them that love God.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="cpoem24">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">God works not as man works, nor sees<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As man sees, though we mark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ofttimes the moving of His hands<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Beneath the eternal Dark.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We live to Him, we die to Him,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And leave Him all the rest.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus the humble are taught trust, patience, resignation,
obedience, peace of heart, and daily
advancement in sanctification.</p>

<p><em>To our bearing towards others.</em> Humility will
qualify us cordially to recognise whatever worth
they have, to show gentleness and charity to those
among them who are faulty and weak, and thus
will take us along a line of conduct which will
lead to the strengthening of the bonds of brotherhood.
&ldquo;Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to
another, and be clothed with humility: for God
resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the
humble.&rdquo; The word here rendered &ldquo;Be clothed&rdquo;
occurs nowhere else in Scripture. It is borrowed
from a piece of dress worn by servants when they
were doing menial offices, which at once intimated
their station, and fitted them for the performance
of the duties attached to it. Remember that it is
Peter who gives this advice&mdash;the Peter who in
former days so often brought himself into trouble
by his want of humility. Notice, too, the special
point he now has in view. He is pleading for
harmonious action in the Church, a result which
can only be obtained by observing the law of
voluntary subordination to established authority&mdash;an
observance to which the habit of humility will
most effectually contribute. Humility is one of
the chief social and ecclesiastical virtues, through
the medium of which God teaches us what is the
attitude we are to maintain towards those who are
around us.</p>

<p><em>To our Christian work.</em> All the heroes of the
faith in past times avowed their personal infirmities.
Moses, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Peter, Paul&mdash;each,
in one form or another, confessed: &ldquo;When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
I am weak, then am I strong; I can do all things
through Christ who strengtheneth me. I glory in
mine infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest
upon me.&rdquo; We must lay hold of this thought, for
it alone can guard us against discouragement.
As long as we depend on ourselves, God will break
down our confidence by repeated failures; but
when His wisdom has humbled us, His mercy will
lift us up. Why should it not be so? We may
well be humble in our work when we remember
how far we are from being indispensable to God.
He can work either with us or without us, as He
pleases. It is His own order to achieve mighty
moral results through the humblest instrumentalities;
and frequently His independence of us is
taught in a very striking way&mdash;as, for example,
when He calls to Himself some great preacher, or
some man who is doing wide-spread good, in the
midst of his activity and his usefulness. Besides,
we have no monopoly of any one gift of the Christian
life&mdash;either as regards the gift itself or as
regards the quality and extent of the service which
it can be made to render. Others excel us in the
very thing of which we are most proud. Many of
our fellow Christians are doing the same kind of
works as ourselves, only far better. And as to our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
&ldquo;gifts,&rdquo; let us not forget that they <em>are</em> gifts. We
have &ldquo;received&rdquo; them; and why, then, should we
boast as if we had not received them, but were
ourselves the creators of them? Moreover, in
proportion to our gifts, so is our responsibility,
and &ldquo;to whom much is given, of him shall much
be required.&rdquo; Have we used such gifts as we
have as nobly as we might? Have we fallen into
no needless errors, no selfishness, no half-heartedness?
So then, while everything calls us to duty,
there is much to fill us with contrition; and
mingling fidelity and humility together, our exclusive
confidence must be in God. This is the
Divine way which the Divine Teacher teaches to
the humble.</p>

<p><em>The Lord&rsquo;s way.</em> This is a beautiful and lovable
expression. It links earth with heaven. There <em>is</em>
a way which leads to God; a way in which God
walks with us, and we with Him; a way that is
peaceful here, while it leads to the land of rest
above. We begin it in humility, confessing our
sins at the cross, and accepting God&rsquo;s mercy there.
We end it before the throne, casting our crowns
at the feet of Him who died to save us.</p>

<h2><span class="smlfont">VI.</span><br />
<i>THE GRATITUDE OF THE
PARDONED.</i></h2>

<p class="theme">&ldquo;Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many,
are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven,
the same loveth little.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Luke</span> vii. 47.</p>


<p>It has been observed that the Bible records with
great minuteness events which a secular historian
would deem beneath his notice, whilst, on the
other hand, matters of great secular importance
are passed over unmentioned. What ordinary
historian would think of narrating such a story as
the one we have in the verses before us? The
Bible records it because it is a history of souls.
To a Bible historian, the conversion of a soul is
an event of unique sublimity, and everything that
can illustrate it is felt to be a source of deepest
interest. The history of outward events will pass
into oblivion; the history of souls will be read in
eternity.</p>

<p>The narrative before us is one of the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
beautiful and touching in the gospel record. It
was a saying of Gregory the Great: &ldquo;Whenever
I think of this story I am more inclined to weep
over it than to preach upon it.&rdquo; It is just the tale
to prompt deep, quiet feeling rather than elaborate
disquisition. It contains an illustration in
real life of the old promise: &ldquo;A bruised reed shall
He not break, and the smoking flax shall He
not quench.&rdquo; It declares the Saviour&rsquo;s matchless
sympathy for the sinner, and the most broken-hearted
sinner&rsquo;s hope in Him. It teaches these
lessons for all time, since in Christ and in His
system of Redemption there can be no change.
Let us look at the narrative somewhat closely, and
may God help us to see in it Christ as the refuge
of the lost, and the thankfulness to Him which
must possess the soul whom He has saved. When
we have said all we can, there will yet remain
much more to be felt.</p>

<p>Before I proceed, however, let me say that this
narrative must not be confounded with another
which is in many respects like it, and which has
been told by the other evangelists. In both cases,
the name of the host is Simon, and in both a
woman anoints the Lord Jesus, and wipes His
feet with her hair. But the differences are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
numerous. In this case, the host is a Pharisee
living in Galilee, and he looks on Christ with mistrust;
in the other case, the host is a healed leper
in Judea, bound to Christ by grateful love. In
this case, the anointing proceeds from personal and
grateful love, and has no other specialty of motive;
in the other case, Jesus says: &ldquo;Let her alone;
against the day of my burying hath she kept this.&rdquo;
Here, Jesus is blamed by the Pharisee; there, the
woman is blamed by the disciples. Pride is the
root of Simon&rsquo;s objection; the objection of the
disciples springs from selfishness. Here a sinner
is pardoned; there a disciple is honoured. Here,
in all probability, the woman was Mary Magdalene;
there, the woman was the sister of Lazarus.</p>

<p>We have no information as to the reason which
induced this Pharisee to invite Christ to his
house. The verse I have read as a text may
obscurely hint to us, perhaps, that he himself
had come under some obligation to Jesus, and not
feeling any true gratitude, he thought he might
acquit himself of his obligation by a compliment
of this kind! Or the invitation may have sprung
from curiosity, or from vanity, or from ambition.
Possibly he may have wished to play the <em>patron</em>.
Anyhow, we have no sign that he was urged by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
spiritual considerations. Many men come&mdash;if one
might so say&mdash;<em>locally</em> near to Christ, who have no
faith in Him, and no love for Him.</p>

<p>Neither have we any information as to the
reason or reasons which induced Christ to accept
this invitation. Several reasons might be imagined.
He may have hoped, as the opportunity
was specially favourable, to bring a blessing to
the Pharisee&rsquo;s heart. Men are never more open,
or more submissive, or more susceptible to the
word of love, than when they themselves are
showing kindness in the form of the hospitalities
of home and of the family circle. Perhaps, too,
He may have felt that to decline the invitation
would be to lay Himself open to an accusation
on the part of the Pharisees that He neglected or
spurned them, whilst He could put Himself in
close communication with &ldquo;publicans and sinners.&rdquo;
At any rate, we have here a beautiful
instance of the self-denial of His love. He knew
what awaited Him, and yet He went.</p>

<p>And now we have to notice that when Jesus had
passed over the threshold of the Pharisee&rsquo;s house
the door was open to &ldquo;a woman who was a
sinner.&rdquo; How was this? The simple and sufficient
answer is that Jesus was there. Otherwise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
she would not have dared to enter within the perfumed
respectability and sanctity of such a place.
That would have been a terror to such a fallen
one as she. But redeeming love had already
begun its work upon her heart, so that she could
come without misgiving, could enter with a holy
confidence. When Christ appears, grace bears
the sceptre, and the law loses its power to
alarm.</p>

<p>We may take this incident, therefore, as a
striking illustration of the spirit of Christ and of
His true followers, as contrasted with Pharisaism
in its suspiciousness, its blindness, its narrowness,
and its ascetic scrupulosity.</p>

<p>The woman, probably under the pressure of
gratitude for some act of compassionate love
already received from Christ, is full of the holiest
and tenderest emotions. In a fine, sacred humility,
she weeps, and washes His feet with her
tears. True tears they are, for they are the tears
of penitence&mdash;and not of penitence only, but of
thankfulness also. Confused and bewildered,
perhaps, she wipes the feet on which they have
fallen with her hair, and then kisses them, and
anoints them with costly ointment! Such is the
gratitude of the pardoned&mdash;deep, strong,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
irrepressible. And she expresses it in touchingly
significant ways.</p>

<p>The woman&rsquo;s action was distasteful to the
Pharisee. The touch of a Gentile, or of a notoriously
wicked person, was supposed to leave
pollution behind it, and therefore by the Pharisees
it was scrupulously avoided. Thus Simon had
no understanding whatever of the scene before
him. He had no eyes to see, no ears to hear,
how the angels were filling heaven with the music
of their joy over this poor sinner who had repented.
A weak human virtue might be contaminated
by contact with such an one as she had
been; but not His who was the Christ of God.
No doubt, apart from the sanctifying influences of
the Holy Spirit, apart from the strength which
God imparts to the soul by His grace, a man
does run the risk of polluting his morality by
allowing it to be touched by the impure streams
of his fellow-creatures&rsquo; vices. This has always
been so fully recognised that we have a whole
system of proverbial philosophy on the point.
Christ, however, was perfect, and His purity was
such that it could not incur this danger. Outward
contact with &ldquo;sinners&rdquo; could bring no
contamination to Him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
Simon took offence at the conduct of the
woman, and began at once to indulge in dark,
though unspoken, suspicions against Christ for
permitting it. His suspicion took this form:
&ldquo;This man professes to be a prophet, and is
regarded as a prophet by His followers. But
surely, if He were a prophet, He would have
known this woman&rsquo;s character, and would have
repelled her from Him, instead of permitting such
demonstrations of affection as these.&rdquo; Simon&rsquo;s
notion of a &ldquo;prophet&rdquo; was that he must possess
at least two qualifications. (1) He must have a
knowledge of the characters of the persons with
whom He has to deal. On behalf of merely
ordinary, human prophets, this was an exaggerated
claim. To what prophet could Simon point
who was able to read the heart? How did he
know that Christ had ever seen this woman
before? And on the supposition that He had not,
on what ground could Simon demand that, in
order to be entitled to the designation of a prophet,
He should show an insight into her character at
the commencement of the very first interview.
Christ had the insight; but Simon felt constrained
to doubt it for no other reason than that He did not
instantly repel the woman from Him. (2) And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
so, in Simon&rsquo;s judgment, the second qualification
of a &ldquo;prophet&rdquo; consisted in such a moral exclusiveness
as would forbid contact with sinners.
He thought that, if Christ did know what manner
of woman this was, His tolerance of her conduct
at this time was sufficient proof that He could not
be a good man, and was not, therefore, to be
regarded as a prophet. A prophet&rsquo;s sanctity
would have forbidden such a scene as this. But
again we ask, Whence could such a notion have
sprung? Who among the &ldquo;prophets&rdquo; ever
stood aloof from sinners? Was it not emphatically
to sinners that they were sent?</p>

<p>Simon&rsquo;s reasoning was full of sophistry, and
the sophistry came from a defective heart. Had
he known the nature of the Saviour&rsquo;s mission&mdash;as
one which demanded a perfect knowledge of all
hearts, combined with grace, love, and power to
save the worst&mdash;he might perhaps have felt and
reasoned differently.</p>

<p>His thoughts were unspoken, but Christ divined
them, and proceeded to deal with them.
To the personal imputation He made no reply.
It was a little thing to Him to be judged by man.
It was sufficient for Him to aim at two points.
One was to vindicate the woman on well-known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
principles, and the other, to lead the Pharisee to
self-examination. With these two objects in
view, He utters a parable, and applies it to the
case in hand. The parable and its application
are both marked by a mingled faithfulness and
love. He makes Simon himself to be the judge
in the case He describes, and on the basis of
Simon&rsquo;s own judgment He brings the practical
point right home to the proud heart of the man.
By a few sharp and striking contrasts, He shows
that the woman, sinful as she has been, has manifested
more love to Him than Simon Himself
whose guest He is! Though a discredited
stranger, she has done for Him what Simon, His
host, had failed to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master, say on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a certain creditor, who had two
debtors: the one owed him five hundred pence,
and the other fifty. And when they had nothing
to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me
therefore, which of them will love him most?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose, he to whom he forgave most.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou hast rightly judged. Seest thou this
woman? I entered into thine house; thou gavest
me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of
her head. Thou gavest me no kiss: but this
woman since the time I came in hath not ceased
to kiss my feet. My head with oil thou didst not
anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet
with ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee, Her
sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved
much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same
loveth little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having said this, Christ crowns His work of love
by saying to the woman, &ldquo;Thy sins are forgiven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now in all this we have an explanation and a
vindication of the grateful love to Christ which
fills and animates the pardoned soul. This love is
shown to us&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <em>In its source.</em> The grace of Christ in forgiving
sins. Grace! How great! since it forgives
all equally; the debtor who owes five hundred
pence as well and as completely as the one who
owes fifty&mdash;greater sinners and lesser sinners
alike! For sinners of every grade there is but one
relief, and that is Divine mercy&mdash;needed by those
who have sinned least as well as by those who
have sinned most, and equally sufficing for both.
Grace! How free! since it forgives where no
satisfaction can be made. &ldquo;Nothing to pay;&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
such is the condition of every sinner before God.
&ldquo;Without money and without price;&rdquo; such is
God&rsquo;s gracious invitation.</p>

<p>II. <em>In its law.</em> It is in the nature of things
that love should beget love, and that the love thus
originated should be measured by the extent of the
favour which has been shown. &ldquo;We love Him,
because He first loved us.&rdquo; Hence, love does not
precede pardon, but is the fruit of it, and is proportioned
to the sense of obligation. This doctrine,
clear as it is, is not apprehended by all, and is
even contradicted by some. The inveterate spirit
of self-righteousness has made men say: &ldquo;See
this woman. By loving much she obtains the
forgiveness of many sins.&rdquo; This is palpably the
reverse of <em>Christ&rsquo;s</em> teaching in this case. Love to
God can never be the growth of unrenewed and
unforgiven hearts. &ldquo;To whom little is forgiven,
the same loveth little.&rdquo; This shows the true
order: forgiveness and then love. So that love is
no plea for pardon; Christ does not say, &ldquo;Thy
love hath saved thee,&rdquo; but &ldquo;thy faith.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="cpoem20">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I love the Lord. He lent an ear<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He rescued me from all my fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Therefore I love the Lord.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>III. <em>In its character.</em> It is an all-absorbing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
feeling, which prompts the offering of the best
gifts to the Saviour, and which fills such offerings
with the spirit of devoutness, humility, and self-denial.</p>

<p>Two closing thoughts.</p>

<p>1. Men may be very near to the source of salvation
and eternal life, without coming into the
realisation of these blessings. In the outward
sense, Christ was very near to this Pharisee and
to his friends; but they did not perceive His
spiritual power. They thought He was only a
man like unto themselves; possibly, perhaps, on a
somewhat higher plane of manhood, though many
of them do not seem to have given Him credit
even for that. His forgiveness was announced to
this poor sinful, but contrite woman in their hearing;
but the best effect it had upon them was to
fill them with a dubious wonder, and to set them
on questioning His authority. Near as they were
to Him, they failed to see in Him, what &ldquo;the
woman who was a sinner&rdquo; saw. Such is the
position, practically, of multitudes to-day. Not,
indeed, that their nearness to Christ is a local
nearness, as in the case of those who were immediately
around Him in the days of His flesh. They
could look upon His outward form, could literally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
hear His voice. Not so now. But there is another
nearness to Him which is moral and spiritual. We
have His Word&mdash;the record of His life, the Divine
repository of His teaching. We have the ordinances
of His worship&mdash;ordinances by which His
Word is brought more home to our understandings
and hearts. We have the influences of His truth
shed over all the scenes in which we move. The
surface influences of Christianity modify and, to
some extent, mould the whole of our social life.
Moreover, Scripture takes account of the differences
in human character. This woman, who was a
sinner, and this Pharisee were not alike in their
relation to Christ. There was one to whom He
said, &ldquo;Thou art not far from the kingdom of
God.&rdquo; Not far from it, and yet not in it. Are
there no such cases now? All are sinners; but
depravity is developed in much grosser forms in
some than in others; and religious influences,
which fall short of effecting a complete conversion,
nevertheless often deter men from plunging into
extreme vice. It is mournfully possible to be near
to Christ, and yet not to come into the enjoyment
of His salvation.</p>

<p>2. On the other hand, there are instances in
which people obtain salvation who seem, as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
character, farthest away from it. The case of this
sinful woman is an illustration in point. We have
no right to mitigate or to extenuate her guilt. Let
it be recognised in all its dark completeness. As
an actual sinner she had sunk very low. Her sin
was against nature&rsquo;s purest laws, and was of the
kind that soon and effectually kills shame&mdash;one of
the most fatal forms of sin, and declared to be such,
not only by God&rsquo;s law, but by the common consent
of the universal conscience of the civilised world;
a sin committed against the strongest restraints&mdash;the
restraints of sacred womanhood; perhaps
against the memory of the holy associations of
childhood, a father&rsquo;s tenderness, a mother&rsquo;s love,
and all the joy of a happy home. Such was this
woman&mdash;&ldquo;a bruised reed.&rdquo; But she was brought
to tears under a sense of Paradise lost, the tears
of despair; and yet again to tears of joy under the
sense of Paradise regained. How many more&mdash;far
off as she&mdash;have been made nigh; treated by
fellow sinners as the offscouring of the earth, yet
drawn to the Saviour. They are brought to the
cross; they repent, believe, are sanctified, and
exult in the consciousness of eternal life. Constrained
by the mercies of God, they yield themselves
a living sacrifice to Him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
The whole scene before us is one of the boldest
triumphs of reconciliation and love, in contrast
with Pharisaic suspicion and unforgivingness; and
it supplies the fullest inspiration for the largest
hope.</p>

<p>May we all come to Christ as this woman did,
and hear, as she heard, His gentle &ldquo;Go in peace!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><span class="smlfont">VII.</span><br />
<i>CONSECRATION.</i></h2>

<p class="theme">&ldquo;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,
that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be
not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the
renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good,
and acceptable, and perfect will of God.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Romans</span> xii. 1, 2.</p>


<p>In bringing this passage before you, I have to
dwell specifically on the motives to self-consecration
to God, and to what is involved therein; and
I do so with the twofold object of reconsidering
the sources of our Christian hope and strength,
and the incentives to our growth in the Divine life.</p>

<p>The apostle commences his appeal with the
word &ldquo;therefore.&rdquo; This is a logical term, leading
to a conclusion from premises which have been
previously stated. It does not stand alone, but
in an argument resumes in itself all that has been
advanced. Take careful note of the simple words
of Scripture. There is point in them all. If, for
example, the use of the word &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
text be overlooked, we shall be unable properly to
feel the force of the apostle&rsquo;s appeal. What is it,
then, that the apostle has said in this epistle, and
of which he intends, by this word &ldquo;therefore,&rdquo; to
remind his readers? He has been giving to them
a large, full, grand exposition of the great truths
of redemption. He has prepared the way for this
by a graphic picture of the sinfulness and helplessness
of human nature. He has shown that the
heathen world is grossly depraved&mdash;in a state of
alienation from God, which is to a certain extent
wilful (chap. i. 29-32). He has proceeded to
demonstrate that, with all their advantages, the
Jews are no better <em>at heart</em> than the heathen, and
as truly sinful, condemned, and hopeless as they
(ii. 17-24). The conclusion supplied by these
facts is, that none are righteous&mdash;that all, Jews
and Gentiles alike, have sinned and come short of
the glory of God, and that all stand on the same
ground of spiritual danger. This brings out the fact
that redemption is the pressing need of the whole
world. The way is now clear for the presentation
of the gospel. <em>The basis of redemption is Christ&rsquo;s
work of atonement.</em> The foundation of the plan
of salvation is God&rsquo;s free grace&mdash;His boundless,
sovereign love. Christ came forth from the Father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
as the expression of this. He suffered, bled, died
for us, to meet the claims of the Divine law on
our behalf, and to procure our justification and
peace. &ldquo;Being justified freely by His grace
through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation
through faith in His blood&rdquo; (iii. 24, 25). &ldquo;Jesus
Christ, who was delivered for our offences&rdquo; (iv. 25).
&ldquo;For when we were yet without strength, in due
time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely
for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure
for a good man some would even dare to die. But
God commendeth His love toward us in that, while
we were yet sinners, Christ died for us&rdquo; (v. 6-8).
Salvation, then, is founded upon the atonement of
Christ&mdash;a proper work of propitiation, providing
for pardon and justification. <em>The condition of this
salvation on our part is simply the acceptance of it by
faith.</em> Faith is primarily the repose of the soul
in Christ&rsquo;s redeeming work&mdash;a yielding to God&rsquo;s
method of saving us. It operates to this end independently&mdash;yea,
even to the exclusion&mdash;of all
works of self-righteousness. &ldquo;By the deeds of
the law shall no flesh living be justified.&rdquo; It is
inconsistent with all boasting. &ldquo;Where is boasting,
then? It is excluded. By what law? Of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
works? Nay, but by the law of faith. Therefore
we conclude that a man is justified by faith without
the deeds of the law.&rdquo; This simple condition
of salvation is the only one which can be adapted
to our need. Sinners as we are, our condition is
hopeless unless redemption be offered to us as a
free gift. <em>This redemption is secured to all who believe
by God&rsquo;s unalterable purpose and promise.</em> It
is not vitally affected by recurring doubts and
fears, nor even by our often insufficient struggles
against sin (viii. 28-39). <em>The result is inconceivably
glorious</em>; freedom from condemnation, adoption
into God&rsquo;s family, joy, peace, full favour with
God here, and heaven with its perfect glory, consummated
in the resurrection, hereafter.</p>

<p>Now, it is at the close of all this that the apostle&rsquo;s
&ldquo;therefore&rdquo; comes; and these are the facts and
principles which give to it its point and force.
It links all the disclosures of Divine love with the
obligations of redeemed souls. Since God has done
so much as this for you, what then? By the
remembrance of the sin which left you without
hope; by the greatness of the love of God who, to
save you, gave His well-beloved Son to an atoning
death on your behalf; by the greatness of the love
of Christ who, to save you, consecrated Himself to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
this perfect sacrifice; by His birth and death, by
His cross and passion, by His resurrection and
ascension; by the freeness and the simplicity of
the condition on which Christ&rsquo;s salvation becomes
yours; by your present peace; by your hope which
blooms with immortality and with eternal life; by
<em>these</em>, <em>the mercies of God</em>, I beseech you, yield yourselves
to God. That surrender must be the first,
the natural, the inevitable result of any vivid
and practical realisation of the Divine goodness.
&ldquo;Yield your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
to God, which is your reasonable service.
And be not conformed to this world: but be ye
transformed by the renewing of your mind, that
ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable,
and perfect will of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Apostle Paul was pre-eminently the teacher
of what are called the doctrines of grace. In the
system of Divine truth which he gives us, he leaves
no room for the indulgence on man&rsquo;s part of the
least sentiment of pride. The gospel, in his view,
is the Divine expedient for what must otherwise
have been a desperate and hopeless case; an expedient,
therefore, which&mdash;since, from first to last,
it is the expression of God&rsquo;s free and sovereign
love&mdash;cannot allow of any self-glorying to man as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
unregenerate, or of any self-satisfaction to man as
Christian. Hence the uniformity and consistency
of his teaching with respect to &ldquo;works.&rdquo; In the
believer and the unbeliever alike, these &ldquo;works,&rdquo;
judged by &ldquo;the law&rdquo;&mdash;the standard of moral perfection&mdash;are
all defective, and therefore unavailing.
The same truth applies to them all at every stage
of the Christian&rsquo;s progress towards heaven. In
no sense does salvation come by &ldquo;works,&rdquo; &ldquo;lest
any man should boast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On this point, however, the apostle has always
been misunderstood by persons who have pushed
his teaching to an illegitimate conclusion. If all
be of &ldquo;grace,&rdquo; why insist upon &ldquo;works&rdquo;? The
objection was made in his day, and he met it. It
is made in our day, and has still to be met. It
is sufficiently met by Paul&rsquo;s own method. Paul&rsquo;s
doctrine of grace could never, in his mind, lead to
&ldquo;licentiousness,&rdquo; and it is one of the most remarkable
phenomena of religious thought that it
should have ever been suspected of doing so. The
Christian man, in Paul&rsquo;s view, is the regenerate
man; and the regenerate man is the holy man.
Without the spirit and life of holiness Paul would
have deemed it absurd to consider a man a
Christian at all. The passage before us, even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
if there were no others of the same kind, is sufficient
to prove how indissolubly connected are
privilege and obligation in the Christian life. As
we have seen, the apostle draws the exhortations
which commence with this chapter, and which are
exhaustively presented in all their variety and
comprehensiveness&mdash;exhortations to a complete
consecration to God in all the practical forms
which it can assume&mdash;from the great gospel system,
the system of salvation by grace and by grace
alone; evidently taking it for granted that, by the
contemplation of the grace for man which is in
Christ Jesus, the minds of his readers would be
softened, and prepared to acknowledge the claim.</p>

<p>What, then, is the nature of the consecration to
which we are thus urged? &ldquo;That ye present your
bodies a living sacrifice, holy, and acceptable to
God, which is your reasonable service.&rdquo; Every
word in this description tells: and if we gather
together the elements of the service commended,
we shall find that nothing is wanting, and that
under the various particulars we may range all the
duties and beauties of a consecrated Christian life.</p>

<p>The only point on which a question might be
raised is as to the meaning of the terms: &ldquo;That ye
present your <em>bodies</em> a <em>living</em> sacrifice.&rdquo; Some have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
supposed a contrast here between the dead bodies
of the animals offered in the old sacrifices and the
living self-consecration of the Christian. If the
supposition be just, the idea is both beautiful and
suggestive. I think, however, that the ultimate
meaning of the apostle is that the believer in Christ
should devote <em>himself</em> wholly to God, and that the
term &ldquo;your bodies&rdquo; is only another term for
&ldquo;yourselves.&rdquo; We cannot imagine an acceptable
bodily, or external sacrifice, without the participation
in it of the conscience, the judgment, the
heart, the whole man. The apostle puts his
thought somewhat more fully in the kindred
passage: &ldquo;Ye are bought with a price; therefore
glorify God in your body and in your spirit which
are God&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Observe, then, the elements of this
consecration.</p>

<p>1. <em>Individuality.</em> It is to be a personal thing.
&ldquo;Present yourselves.&rdquo; We cannot fulfil our
Christian mission by transferring it to other hands.
There are no proxies in religion. Organisations,
committees, associations, the giving of money&mdash;all
have their propriety, but none of them can take the
place of personal &ldquo;presentation.&rdquo; For convenience&rsquo;
sake, organisations of various kinds may be resorted
to with a view to the maintenance and spread of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
gospel in the world, and undoubtedly may be usefully
employed in spheres beyond the reach of personal
endeavour; but the individual Christian must
<em>himself</em> be engaged in the service of God. Every
believer in the Saviour has his own sphere of service,
in which no fellow creature can be substituted for
Him. The Christian law is: personal service always
in so far as it is possible; vicarious service only in
so far as personal service cannot be rendered.</p>

<p>2. <em>Activity.</em> &ldquo;A living sacrifice.&rdquo; No man
fulfils his Christian commission in mere retirement
and contemplation. It is true that he is not to be
&ldquo;of the world;&rdquo; but in the nature of the case he
must be &ldquo;in&rdquo; it. Retirement and contemplation
are, indeed, needed for the rest and growth of the
soul; but action is at least equally indispensable.
Our practical life is the chief part of our testimony
for God, and the chief weapon of our aggressive
warfare upon the unbelief and irreligion around us;
and in order that it may be effective, it is required,
in its fulness and in its energy, to be pervaded,
invigorated, impelled, and directed by the Christian
spirit. Every scene, every experience, every development
of life is to be hallowed. If we &ldquo;present
ourselves a living sacrifice,&rdquo; we relinquish all self-claim,
and give ourselves up to God to be used by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
Him for the purposes of His glory. As Christ&rsquo;s
sacrifice began with the moment when He left His
Father&rsquo;s throne, so ours must begin with the first
consciousness of our salvation&mdash;&ldquo;a living sacrifice,&rdquo;
the consecration of the whole life with all its
powers.</p>

<p>3. <em>Holiness.</em> &ldquo;Holy,&rdquo; because <em>to God</em>, with the
full intention and devotion of the soul. This
scarcely needs to be insisted on. There may be
an apparent religious devotedness which is not
real, because it takes the form of ostensibly religious
acts&mdash;acts, however, which have not their origin
and their impelling force in grateful love to God
for His saving mercy, but in some kind of selfishness,
and which are therefore unholy in themselves,
and unacceptable to God. The consecrated life is
the life which is in sympathy with the whole
character and will of Him by whom the supreme
blessing of redemption has been bestowed.</p>

<p>4. <em>Reasonableness.</em> The true consecration is not
the result of any mere positive or arbitrary enactment,
the ground and propriety of which cannot
be discerned. The true Christian does not spend
his life upon a certain principle, and consequently
in a certain way, merely because he is <em>told</em> to do so.
The service which he renders to God rises out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
his felt <em>relations</em> to God. If it were not commanded
at all&mdash;if it were not even formally hinted at as an
obligation&mdash;it would still be natural, &ldquo;reasonable,&rdquo;
and therefore right. The realised &ldquo;mercies of
God&rdquo; would be instinctively understood to claim
it&mdash;instinctively felt to prompt it. &ldquo;Your reasonable
service.&rdquo; The words are significant. &ldquo;Service&rdquo;
is properly <em>homage</em>. &ldquo;Reasonable&rdquo; is that which
pertains to the <em>mind</em>. So that the apostle&rsquo;s phrase
stands opposed to all mere religious externalism.
It is the homage of the life to God with the full
consent of the mind, in the consciousness of the
sacred obligation arising out of the enjoyment of
the Divine mercy in the salvation of the soul.</p>

<p>Such service is declared to be &ldquo;acceptable to
God.&rdquo; It is so for the sake of Christ whose
grace has infused into the soul the life out of
which it springs; it is so because the motives
which determine it are right and good; and it
is so because it is the loving gift of His own
children.</p>

<p>But the apostle expands his thought, so as to
set forth this consecration under other aspects&mdash;as,
for example, that of <em>nonconformity to the world</em>.
&ldquo;Be not conformed to this world.&rdquo; A word of
explanation is required on the meaning of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
term, &ldquo;this world.&rdquo; It is obvious that this term
has no reference to the external frame of things,
considered in itself. In a loose way we apply the
term &ldquo;world&rdquo; to many things, and Nature is one
of them. But full compliance with the apostle&rsquo;s
admonition in the text is compatible with even an
enthusiastic admiration of Nature. Nature is a
mirror in which we may see the wisdom and the
goodness of God. It is full of the beautiful to
be loved&mdash;full of the sublime to be admired.
Its phenomena, forms, and laws, are worthy of the
most reverential and pleasurable investigation, not
only for what they are in themselves, but because
the most spiritual Christian can say, &ldquo;My Father
made them all: they are His.&rdquo; The term
&ldquo;world,&rdquo; again, sometimes means the aggregate
of human beings; but nonconformity to the world
is at the furthest remove from misanthropy.
Human beings are proper objects of a Christian&rsquo;s
love, and his love for them is shown in the best
efforts he can make for their welfare. Every man
is, to his mind, invested with a sacred importance.
He endeavours to estimate men as fully as possible
in the same way as God does, of whom it is said
that &ldquo;His mercies are over all His works,&rdquo; and
that &ldquo;He so loved the world, that He gave His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&rdquo;
At the lowest, man is God&rsquo;s image&mdash;mournfully
defaced, it is true&mdash;but retaining in his nature
traces enough of his original dignity to compel our
recognition of him as God&rsquo;s handiwork; whilst
also, even at the lowest, he may be brought under
the influences of a gospel which despairs of none.
Neither is there anything in the apostle&rsquo;s injunction
to condemn the social relationships which
prevail amongst us or to weaken our appreciation
of them. The true Christian, indeed, will ever be
the best husband, the best wife, the best parent,
the best child, the best friend. All these natural
relationships are capable of being ennobled by
the holy, sanctifying influences of true religion.
God Himself often appeals to them as types of
the relations in which He stands to us, and as
explanations of the tenderness of the love He
cherishes for us. How prominent is the position
they take in the epistles. The inspired writers
thought none of them beneath their notice. God
has given to us His will in connection with such
humble things as domestic service, slavery, and
the like. Neither does the apostle here call upon
us to separate ourselves from the common business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
of secular life. Scripture again and again enforces
the honest doing of the work of every day, on
which the bread of every day depends. Nor is
there here any prohibition of the enjoyment of
the utmost happiness which the sinless pleasures
of our outward life can afford. The Christian is
peculiarly fitted for such enjoyment, because he
can receive it with a devoutly thankful heart, and
in a spirit which will keep it from being harmful.</p>

<p>This term, &ldquo;the world,&rdquo; means <em>the age</em>, or the
temporal conditions now existing, considered from
a moral and spiritual point of view. &ldquo;The world,&rdquo;
therefore, to which we are not to be &ldquo;conformed&rdquo;
is the order and course of life followed by those to
whom the present is all and eternity nothing.
The Christian is to regard life from another, a
higher&mdash;namely, a spiritual and eternal&mdash;point of
view, and to live accordingly. It is the <em>wrong
spirit</em> of life that the apostle calls us away from&mdash;the
life which is governed by &ldquo;worldly&rdquo; impulses
and motives. His injunction is like unto that of
another apostle: &ldquo;Love not the world, neither the
things that are in the world. If any man love the
world, the love of the Father is not in him. For
all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the
lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth
away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the
will of God abideth for ever.&rdquo; &ldquo;The lust of the
flesh&rdquo;&mdash;carnality&mdash;the lowest of all the forms of
self-gratification&mdash;that which makes the drunkard,
the profligate, the debauchee. &ldquo;The lust of the
eyes&rdquo;&mdash;the disposition to attach ourselves to what
is external, showy, dazzling. &ldquo;The pride of life&rdquo;&mdash;the
tendency to glory in anything which ministers
to our self-importance in our worldly position&mdash;wealth,
rank, station. All these things are passing
away, and are therefore unworthy of the supreme
place in our hearts. Enjoyments springing out
of them, hopes founded upon them, must perish.
Only he that &ldquo;doeth the will of God&rdquo;&mdash;living
above the love of the world, by living to God and
in the supreme love of Him&mdash;&ldquo;abideth for ever&rdquo;
in the higher and happier order of being.</p>

<p>There is a proper &ldquo;use&rdquo; of the world, which
is easily distinguished from its &ldquo;abuse.&rdquo; The
worldly spirit of an unchristian man says, &ldquo;Let
us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.&rdquo; The
ascetic spirit in a Christian man says, &ldquo;All
contact with the world is dangerous: we must
have nothing to do with it. Touch not, taste not,
handle not.&rdquo; The true spirit of Christianity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
says, &ldquo;Use the world, but do not abuse it.&rdquo; The
Christian&rsquo;s inheritance is inclusive of &ldquo;all things.&rdquo;
All may be made to minister to his spiritual
growth, and to become the means of blessing on
his part to others. Avail yourself of all, then,
but within the limits proper to each; never allowing
any, by over indulgence, to check the development
of the inner life. Use the world, but do not
let the world use you. &ldquo;I pray not that Thou
shouldest take them out of the world, but that
Thou shouldest <em>keep them from the evil</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In looking, then, at the idea of nonconformity
to the world, it was in the apostle&rsquo;s mind, we
are impressed by one or two reflections.</p>

<p>1. The apostle takes a wide, free, and exalted
view of his subject. He is in marked dissent
from the spirit of Pharisaism, whether among the
Jews, or in the Christian Church. His plan is
different from the ordinary rules and restraints
which men put upon themselves, and which attach
(sometimes arbitrarily enough) merely to certain
habits and forms of life which are of no moment.
Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;world&rdquo; does not mean certain conditions
of society, certain amusements, or certain occupations,
conventionally marked off from all the rest
as being specially wrong. It is not a mere cleaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
of the outside of the platter. He goes deeply
into the heart of things. What he teaches is
this: &ldquo;Ye are God&rsquo;s redeemed, disciples of
Christ, heirs of glory.&rdquo; Live under the inspiration
of all this&mdash;all will then follow that ought to
follow. You are no longer under law, which
says, &ldquo;Touch not, taste not, handle not&mdash;stand
entirely aloof;&rdquo; but under grace, with love to
God as your motive, and the Spirit of Christ as
your guide. He could say, &ldquo;I am not of the
world;&rdquo; and yet He was no prophet of the
wilderness, but a Brother and Sympathiser everywhere.
The first great social act of His public
ministry was to associate Himself with the joy of
life. With its sorrow also He was equally at
home. He lived His Divine life in every scene&mdash;in
His childhood under the roof of His parents,
in the toil for bread, in public, in private, in the
temple, in the family at Bethany. There is no
allowable scene in which we move, and with
which we mingle, from which His sanctifying
presence is withheld. We have no need to be
afraid to go where He has been before us, if only
we go in His spirit. &ldquo;They are not of the world,
even as I am not of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. This law lays no hard bondage on life. Not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
on its duties; for Christianity raises them all into
consecration;&mdash;not on its affections; for Christianity
purifies them all;&mdash;nor on its lawful enjoyments;
for Christianity forbids nothing but sin.
Worldliness is determined by the <em>spirit</em> of our
life, not by the objects with which we have to do.
It is only &ldquo;the <em>lust</em> of the flesh, the <em>lust</em> of the
eye, and the <em>pride</em> of life&rdquo; that are prohibited.
It is not a worldly object that makes us worldly,
but the worldly spirit with which we regard it.</p>

<p>3. It is easy to see that this principle of nonconformity
to the world is in constant requisition.
There is abundant scope for it. The opinions of
men and the known will of God are often in competition;
it ought never to be a matter of doubt
as to which we prefer. We are often exposed
to allurement into scenes which are notoriously
unfavourable to the development of the spiritual
life; there ought not to be even a momentary
uncertainty as to our willingness to resist the
allurement&mdash;not merely for our own sake, but for
the sake of Him whose &ldquo;mercies&rdquo; we enjoy,
whose we are, and whom we profess to serve.
There should never be any room for the question
as to whether we are on the side of right or
wrong, holiness or sin, spirituality or carnality,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
conscience or convenience, charity or harshness,
faith or unbelief.</p>

<p>Thus we see that, whilst in one aspect of it
Christianity is broad, in another it is narrow.
&ldquo;Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, that
leadeth unto life.&rdquo; These are the words of the
Divine Author of our faith. This is the chief
ground of dislike which men of the world have
to the practical claims of the gospel. Say with
Paul that everything we do must be done to the
glory of God; say with Christ that sin is in our
secret thoughts as well as in our acts, and then
the complaint of &ldquo;strictness&rdquo; is instantly heard.
Yet is it not evident that an inward holiness is
the only thing that can be taught, and that without
inward holiness there is no real holiness at all?
The truth is that men secretly want concessions
to be made in favour of their favourite sins&mdash;one
for his ambition, another for his unlawful or
questionable attachments, another for his covetousness,
another for his liberty to be dishonest
in trade or insincere in society, another&mdash;where
shall we stop? Concessions? Men may make
concessions in these directions in the name of
Christianity; but Christianity itself disowns them.
&ldquo;What fellowship hath righteousness with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
unrighteousness? and what communion hath light
with darkness? and what concord hath Christ
with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth
with an infidel? and what agreement hath
the temple of God with idols? for ye are the
temple of the living God; as God hath said, I
will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will
be their God, and they shall be my people.
Wherefore come out from among them, and be
ye separate, and touch not the unclean thing;
and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto
you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith
the Lord Almighty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be not conformed to this world.&rdquo; So obviously
true are the remarks which have been made, that
one reflection might well excite a momentary surprise.
It might be said, &ldquo;Is not unworldliness
of the very essence of the new life? And if it be,
why recommend that which must follow in the
due course of things?&rdquo; It is true that unworldliness
<em>is</em> of the essence of the new life; but we have
to remember that we receive that life, not perfectly
developed, but in its germ; and that the process
of its growth is impeded by what remains of the
old life which it is destined gradually, and by-and-by
completely, to replace. This is the phenomenon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
which Paul describes when he speaks of
the conflict between the &ldquo;old&rdquo; man and the
&ldquo;new.&rdquo; Our will is called upon at every point
to decide between the impulses of our new condition
and the habits of the old.</p>

<p>In conclusion, how is this nonconformity to the
world, in the spirit of a grateful consecration to
God, to be attained? &ldquo;Be ye transformed by the
renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is
that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.&rdquo;
This is the great desideratum&mdash;the great necessity.
The primary change must take place in the mind&mdash;not
in its nature, but in the kind and order of
its <em>life</em>. It must be &ldquo;renewed&rdquo; in its bias, in its
inclinations, in its aspirations, so that it may be
able to understand and appreciate the Divine will,
and to address itself to the order of service which
the Father of mercies shall accept.</p>

<p>It may be said, &ldquo;What do we know of the
spiritual world? And how can we be conformed
to a world of which we know nothing?&rdquo; The
answer is, that our very Christianity supposes the
change which sets this objection aside. Our love
to this present world can only be subdued by its
being superseded <em>by</em> another, or subordinated <em>to</em>
another. Our love to Christ is the great secret of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
our attachment to heaven and to heavenly things.
Given a soul under the influence of love to God,
and loyalty to God must follow.</p>

<p>In order to this, however, there must be self-knowledge.
We must see our &ldquo;differences.&rdquo;
There must be the study of the character of Christ.
There must also be earnest prayer for, and trust
in, the help of the Holy Spirit. The work before
us is more than an occasional outburst of religious
sentiment; more than spasmodic, self-denying
charity under the influence of suddenly awakened
emotion; more than scrupulosity about small
matters of pleasure or pursuit. <em>It is a life</em>; and
as such it has spontaneity, freedom, and blessedness.
In many an instance it attains wonderful
maturity on earth; it is perfected in heaven.</p>

<p>Is this life ours? Oh, accept the one and only
Saviour&mdash;exclusive in His claims, yet offering His
mercy to all. You are conscious of sin, and this
makes you feel (if you reflect) your need of salvation.
Take it from Him. All He asks is that
you should turn from the sin that made Him bleed,
and trust the love which for you was stronger than
death. Strait as is the gate through which you
must enter into &ldquo;life,&rdquo; that life is in itself one of
holy freedom and holy joy. The &ldquo;gate&rdquo; opens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
into broad fields of exhaustless treasure. Whoever
may represent the Christian life as monotonous
and poor, we say it is not so. It is quietness of
heart, loftiness of feeling, sweet submission, trust,
loyalty to the highest, aspiration after the best,
the abnegation of self in blessing others and in
glorifying the God and Father of all; such is the
life to which the Christian is called. We challenge
the world to produce a single case of a
Christian regretting his consecration, or confessing
that he made a sorry exchange, when he left
the world&rsquo;s delusive hopes for pardon, peace,
the Father&rsquo;s smile, the way of holiness, and the
assurance of heaven. The wholly consecrated
Christian is the wholly happy one.</p>

<h2><span class="smlfont">VIII.</span><br />
<i>CHRISTIANITY IN OUR DAILY
LIFE.</i></h2>

<p class="theme">&ldquo;Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of
the Lord Jesus.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Colossians</span> iii. 17.</p>


<p>One of the most striking characteristics of the
Christian religion is what I may term its <em>universality</em>.
I mean that its obligations and privileges
cover the whole ground of human life&mdash;present
and to come. This fact, which is abundantly
illustrated and enforced in the New
Testament, is also clearly hinted at in the Old.
It seems to have been present to the Psalmist&rsquo;s
mind in the parallel he draws in the nineteenth
Psalm between the sun, whose going forth is
from the end of heaven, whose circuit is unto
the ends of it, and from whose heat nothing is
hid; and &ldquo;the law of the Lord&rdquo; which, in its
perfectness, comes into satisfying contact with all
human need. It converts the soul, turning it
towards itself, the source of light. It makes wise
the simple, who unreservedly yield to its influence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
It rejoices the heart, anxious to be right, as it is
itself perfect. It enlightens the eyes with a purity
of truth which has no admixture of error. It
cleanses from secret faults. It keeps back the
servant of the Lord from presumptuous sins.</p>

<p>This universality gives to Christianity its grand
ideal character. It teaches that, morally considered,
sin is the condition of <em>all men</em>; that condemnation
is the result of sin to <em>all men</em>; and that the love of
the Father, the sacrifice of the Son, and the regenerating
and sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit
have direct bearings on the spiritual wants of <em>all
men</em>. Christianity meets an absolute ruin by an
absolute restoration; so that, as there is nothing
in man and in his relations to the universe which
sin has not defiled and degraded, so there is nothing
in man and in his relations to the universe which
Christianity is not designed and destined to uplift
and to purify.</p>

<p>This element of universality comes out very
strikingly in the chapter before us. The apostle
is describing the spiritual life. In its essence, it
is an abandonment of the &ldquo;old&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;putting off the
old man,&rdquo; as a dress thrown completely aside; and
an adoption of the new&mdash;&ldquo;putting on the new
man&rdquo;&mdash;the prodigal&rsquo;s rags exchanged for the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
robe. In its range, it is universal&mdash;<em>within</em>, setting
the affections on heavenly things; <em>without</em>,
renouncing the deeds of the life of sin, and manifesting
the virtues of the life of holiness. It is
universal also in its application&mdash;involving personal
purity, and giving its own tone and spirit to all the
relationships, to all the worship, and to all the
work, of life. The whole is summed up in the remarkable
words of the text: &ldquo;And whatsoever ye
do in word or deed, do <em>all</em> in the name of the Lord
Jesus.&rdquo; We are the subjects of a Providence and
a Grace inclusive of every moment and every
incident. God, on His part, demands of us a consecration
that shall leave nothing (however unimportant,
relatively considered) unhallowed&mdash;not a
single affection, no domestic or social relationship,
nothing in speech, nothing in conduct. It is
the same truth that the same apostle elsewhere
expresses: &ldquo;Whether therefore ye eat, or drink,
or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I want to offer to your attention at this time a
single application of this principle&mdash;its application
to the common, secular work of life.</p>

<p>At first sight, it seems strange that by far the
greater part of human life should be appointed by
God to be spent in worldly toil. This strangeness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
is augmented in proportion as our aim is towards
a life distinctively and completely Christian. Considering
the supreme importance of the spiritual
and the eternal; considering, too, the uncertain
duration of our life, notwithstanding the fact that
it involves the immeasurable interests of eternity;
and considering, still further, the manifold obstacles
in the way of a man&rsquo;s salvation&mdash;we might
have supposed that God&rsquo;s providential arrangements
would have secured to us far more freedom
from worldly labour and care than we enjoy. It
would not have been surprising if He had said to
us: &ldquo;Retire much; rest much&mdash;that you may
have much time for thought and prayer.&rdquo; But it
is not so. Six days for work; one day for rest and
worship! Certain exceptions apart, toil is, for
most men, the hard and unremitting condition of
life; often indeed&mdash;especially in our cities, and in
&ldquo;hard times&rdquo; like the present&mdash;toil that demands
the straining of every nerve, the putting forth to
the utmost of every energy, and the employment
of every moment. The best of us come to our
Sabbaths like wrestlers who sit and rest for a while
between the conflict past and the conflict to come.
This is the experience of most of us: business men
who have to fight in the great competitions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
trade; working men to strive for a sufficiency of
bread and raiment for themselves and their families;
fathers and mothers, masters and servants who
have to meet the manifold duties and worries of
domestic life. We come to our Sabbath-rest, probably
with the feeling that, on the whole, during
the week, we have <em>lost</em> rather than <em>gained</em> in relation
to our spiritual interests. Are we right in the
feeling? Must our daily work be a hindrance to
us? Is it impossible for us so to engage in it as
to find it spiritually helpful? The text before us
settles the point. It presents to us an obligation
that is inclusive of every word and deed, and which
must consequently include the common toil of
every day. It is an apostolic injunction, and the
injunction presupposes its own practicability.
&ldquo;Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all <em>in the
name of the Lord Jesus</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That secular work is not <em>necessarily</em> spiritually
helpful we know too well. Idleness is always disastrous;
but there is much worldly work which is
more disastrous still. Tens of thousands pursue
it daily in utter godlessness, and train themselves
by it to intense selfishness and materialism. They
&ldquo;mind earthly things,&rdquo; and &ldquo;glory in their
shame.&rdquo; Even many professing Christians manifest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
an alarming craving for mere worldly enjoyment;
and their luxuries tax them a hundred-fold
more than their benevolence. But it need not be
so. Secular work <em>can</em> be made the means of
spiritual education, and the sphere for the development
of piety.</p>

<p>The first great requisite is conversion. No obligation,
indeed, rests upon Christians which does
not rest upon all men, whether they be Christians
or not. A perfect Christian is simply <em>man as he
ought to be</em>. But in the unchristian man the disposition
is wanting&mdash;he lives to himself. The
Christian, on the contrary, has entered into a new
life. By the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s grace, he has repented
of sin; he is forgiven, accepted, justified, accepted
into Divine sonship; he is under the influence of
new principles&mdash;is essentially in a new world&mdash;acknowledges
a holy law, which he now loves for
its own sake&mdash;is consciously under the eye of a
good Master, who is his Saviour as well as his
Lord&mdash;and is thus moved by a living impulse of
gratitude to Him who has died for him, and whose
he is in life and death. Out of this there comes
the conviction that the one object of life should be
spiritual growth. Commonly men think of life as
having two aims; or rather they try to solve the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
problem of living two lives&mdash;the one present, the
other future; the one worldly, the other religious;
the one affecting the body with its transitory
interests, the other affecting the soul with its
eternal interests. Hence the wide divorce between
&ldquo;the secular&rdquo; and &ldquo;the sacred,&rdquo; work and worship,
holy days and common days. The more
enlightened Christian knows that this is a radical
mistake. The world, time, matter, the body&mdash;all
have their relations and their obligations, their
spheres and their claims; but they do not stand
isolated from the spiritual and the unseen. Separate,
they are godless. They are all intended to
serve as instruments of moral discipline&mdash;to supply
lessons in the school of life;&mdash;all tending, under
God, to the great result. Failures they are, if regarded
as <em>ends</em> in themselves; blessed they are in
proportion as they are religiously used as <em>means</em>.
Apart from the conviction that this should be our
one great aim, it seems impossible to hope that
the spiritual will predominate over the worldly;
the six days&rsquo; secular toil must be destructive of the
day&rsquo;s spiritual culture. The &ldquo;prosperous&rdquo; will
degrade life into a mere pursuit of earthly wealth
with its associated advantages, whilst the rest will
simply continue the hard struggle for daily bread&mdash;&ldquo;the
bread that perisheth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
The life of millions around us seems, religiously
considered, to be an absolute blank. Mix with
them, observe them, and you will be convinced of
this. It is one of the sources of deepest sadness
to a Christian to note the extent to which godlessness
prevails in all ranks of society. Even
amongst Christians themselves there are terrible
invasions of the spirit of worldliness. Let <em>us</em> seek,
by the help of God, the convictions by which this
evil may be checked. The soul is greater than the
body; eternity is greater than time. The material
and the temporal sink into insignificance in contrast
with the spiritual and the eternal. Let the
lower interests serve the higher.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the universality of the
claims which Christianity makes upon us. Its
aim is not to induce us to assume a certain character
merely at certain specified times and in
certain specified places, and to be content with
that. On the contrary, its purpose is to induce
us to do everything in one specified spirit, which
shall shape, give sanctity and consecration to,
the whole. Hence, it is never represented as
working first on the outward habits of men, but
on their hearts. It does not cleanse the outside
of the cup or platter, leaving corruption within;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
but it first endeavours to establish purity within,
and to give the purity which is within a force by
which it shall work outwardly. The outward acts
of the life are but the embodiments of the heart
and will. Thus, whether we be scholars, or merchants,
or preachers, or mechanics, or servants,
we are to carry a soul, sanctified and governed by
Christ, into all our occupations, even the commonest.
Whether we pray or work, whether we
be in the church or the shop, we are to be under
the control of the one Christian spirit.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, there are some occupations in
which it is difficult for Christians to engage, and
some which they ought never to touch. But
apart from these, the work of life is not an evil.
There is no need to retire away from it into solitude
as the only suitable sphere for the development
of piety. A wise Christian looks upon it as
a mode of spiritual culture. It depends upon the
man himself, upon the guiding principle of his life,
as to whether work shall degrade or raise him.</p>

<p>Consider two or three points in illustration and
proof of the truth I am endeavouring to enforce.</p>

<p>I. Secular work requires and cultivates certain
active forces of character which are also required
in the culture of the spiritual life, such, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
example, as <em>clearness and definiteness of aim</em>: so that
there shall be no working in the dark, or in ignorance
of the special end to be attained. &ldquo;This
one thing I do.&rdquo; <em>Perseverance</em>, so that the end,
once clearly ascertained and decided on, shall be
steadily and unflinchingly pursued, until it is accomplished.
<em>Prudence and foresight</em>, so that there
shall be a wise adaptation of means. <em>Energy</em>, so
that every opportunity and every appliance shall
be used to the utmost. <em>Courage</em>, so that no
difficulties shall dismay. All these forces acquire
strength in the earthly sphere, which is a clear
gain, and which may be brought to use in the
spiritual. We, as Christians, have an end to
pursue which must be clearly apprehended; we
must not run uncertainly, or as one that beateth
the air; we must persevere, running with patience
the race that is set before us; our zeal must not
be without knowledge; what our hands find to do
we must do with our might; and we must be in
nothing terrified by our adversaries. So far from
being hindered in all this by the discipline of our
common life, experience proves that indolence in
secular business has a paralysing effect on spiritual
exertion. In spiritual exertion man uses the
same power as in secular, only the field of operation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
is different. But inasmuch as the same
powers are wanted for both, the one may be a true
auxiliary to the other.</p>

<p>II. The same line of remark will apply to the
<em>passive</em> forces of character. They are wanted
equally in the secular and the spiritual, and their
cultivation in the one prepares them for use in the
other. For example: <em>Submission.</em> Many a position
in life is irksome and uncongenial; but
nevertheless it should be accepted as God&rsquo;s providential
arrangement on our behalf. &ldquo;It is not in
man that walketh to direct his steps.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Patience.</em>
Many a result has to be long worked for and long
waited for, often with many disappointments and
reverses.&mdash;<em>Contentment.</em> The worry of life, not its
work, is that which burdens and kills. Looking
on our position as one which God has appointed,
we take it calmly as that which is best for us.&mdash;<em>Trust.</em>
We have simply to rely on God for everything,
remembering that our powers, opportunities,
and results are all under His wise and loving
control. &ldquo;Sufficient unto the day is the evil
thereof,&rdquo; and sufficient also is the grace to bear it.
Our hearts are wearied and worn only as we insist
on carrying heavier burdens than God assigns to
us. How clear it is that all these passive forces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
are needed in our secular work, if it is to be done
well! But it is equally clear that they are needed
just as much in our spiritual life. In it their
growth is an essential element; and they have
their bearing specially on Christian work&mdash;work
done for the spread of religion in the world.</p>

<p>III. Secular work offers important opportunities
for spiritual usefulness. Our most effective
preaching is often that of our unconscious influence.
And let us remember that no amount of formal
sanctity can prevail against the inconsistencies of
our common days. Moreover, our daily, secular
duties bring us into contact with men in ways
which are least open to suspicion. Add to this,
that they put into our hands, in a greater or lesser
degree, resources by which we can materially help
the cause of Christ, and so become, in heart, in
interest, in devotedness, more and more closely
identified with that cause. We can &ldquo;honour the
Lord with our substance, and with the first-fruits
of all our increase,&rdquo; and so find that &ldquo;it is more
blessed to give than to receive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The practical problem that God gives to every
one of us to solve, is to get perfected in our hearts
the feeling that we are doing His will in the
common details of our ordinary vocation as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
as in acts more ostensibly &ldquo;religious.&rdquo; The conclusion
is irresistible; the thing may be done&mdash;but
how? It cannot be done without habitual
self-examination; it cannot be done without prayer;
it cannot be done without reliance on the help of
the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Let us be thankful to God for putting within
our reach the high honour of glorifying Him, for
introducing us to a life so pure in its springs, for
His kindly help in every step of its progress, and
for the hope that it will one day reach its happy
consummation.</p>

<h2><span class="smlfont">IX.</span><br />
<i>UNCONSCIOUS INFLUENCE.</i></h2>

<p class="theme">&ldquo;I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,
they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For
by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou
shalt be condemned.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Matthew</span> xii. 36, 37.</p>


<p>This is a startling, terrifying text; one of many
which tempt men to limitations and compromises
of their meaning. Some persons would not hesitate
to accuse it of extravagance, and even devout
Christians sometimes pause and ask whether it is
to be taken in its absolute literalness. &ldquo;Every
idle word.&rdquo; Is not this the kind of thing which is
least amenable to a vigorous judgment? Is not
the &ldquo;idle,&rdquo; the vain, the worthless, at the worst,
thereby negative? Christ says, No. Speech is a
gift to be put to sanctified uses; and the non-use
as well as the abuse of every gift is sinful. This
utterance of our Divine Master, to be vindicated,
needs only to be understood. Underlying it are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
vital moral considerations which should be devoutly
studied.</p>

<p>There are many ways in which a man can
manifest himself. By his thought, he is always
known to God and to his own heart, but not to
his fellow men. To reveal himself to them, his
thought must somehow find expression. His
actions are mostly intentional and deliberate; but
they are liable to be prompted, inspired, checked,
or controlled by circumstances. So, too, may be
his speech; but there is a spontaneousness, a
freedom, in <em>that</em>, which belongs to no other manifestation
of the man&rsquo;s inward self. Thus it is by
his words that he is best judged. The largest
part of our practical life is resolvable into speech.</p>

<p>Christianity itself is amenable to this law. Think
of the streams of holy speech which have been
flowing through the world for ages, and of the life
they have conveyed to thirsty souls. Think of
these streams as they are flowing to-day in tens of
thousands of Christian congregations, and in innumerable
Sabbath schools. Compare their influence
with that of the dark utterances of heathenism,
and the disturbing teachings of unbelief. Think
of the countless rills of Christian speech which are
flowing to-day from the lips of those who love the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
Saviour, and who are endeavouring to make Him
known in the home, in the sick-chamber, in the
prison-house, and in their various intercourse with
those around them. Compare their influence with
that of the idle, thoughtless, impious, profane talk
of the millions who are living without God; and
then say whether Christianity may or may not be
judged by its words! Lord Jesus, Thou needest
no justification from such imperfect creatures as
we are; but if Thou didst, it would be enough for
us to recall the gracious words that proceeded out
of thine own mouth, and then to challenge the
wisdom of the ages, saying, &ldquo;Never man spake
like this man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The general drift of the passage before us is this,
that man speaks as he is, and is as he speaks, and
that, therefore, by his words he shall be judged.
His words are signs which reveal his character.
Whilst, at the last, he will be judged by his
character, single words and unnoticed deeds will,
if need be, be adduced as proofs of inner and
underlying principles. Of course it is not meant
that words will be the only tests; but our Lord&rsquo;s
language shows that they form a far more important
element of proof than is commonly supposed.
In this light, no manifestation of character is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
insignificant. Everything tells. Words, looks,
even gestures, have their meaning. Often to men&rsquo;s
eyes, and always to God&rsquo;s (though He does not
need them) they are as straws on the stream,
showing the course of the current.</p>

<p>These general reflections supply the basis of the
further reflections I have to offer. My purpose is
twofold: first, to show that, for good or ill, the
life of every one of us is an incessant exercise of
influence; and secondly, to deduce from this fact
some important lessons.</p>

<p>I. Now, generally, when men speak of exerting
influence, the thought present to their minds is of
something exceptional, attractive, commanding, or
formal. Thus, such a phrase as &ldquo;a person of
influence&rdquo; is understood to denote a man who
stands in a position of special advantage, either
(for instance) of wealth, or of mental power, or of
social importance. Hence the notion of influence
is narrowed, and ultimately it becomes false. It
does so in two ways: partly by restricting influence
to a few, and then by confining it among these few
to certain peculiarities of character or of circumstance.
The truth is that influence is always going
forth from every man, and from everything <em>in</em> man.</p>

<p>There are two ways in which men act upon one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
another. They do so either directly, deliberately,
and intentionally, or, otherwise, indirectly and
unconsciously. Thus, if I want to make men
around me generous, I may write, preach, speak,
use arguments, multiply incentives, enforce appeals.
In all this I am conscious that I have a purpose
to accomplish, and in everything I say I keep that
purpose in view. If I succeed, I do so through
the intentional influence I have put into operation.
I have tried to realise a definite result, and I have
not been disappointed. But I can teach generosity
in another way. Obedient to the impulses of my
own heart, I may relieve the need of some poor
blind beggar on the road, who implores the passer-by
to help him. This act may be noticed by a
third person whom I did not know to be near, and
it may so impress him as to open his heart and
his hand to do the kindness he had not thought of
doing. Now I had no such design with respect to
<em>him</em>; for the time, I had nothing in view beyond
meeting an appeal for help which came personally
to myself. I was unconscious of the influence I
exerted upon the person who followed my example,
and yet I did for him as much as if I had set myself
to develop an argument or to enforce a claim.</p>

<p>Now, if at this point the question be asked:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
&ldquo;Are we responsible for this undesigned influence?&rdquo;
the answer is that we certainly <em>are</em> so,
inasmuch as it springs from, and manifests, character.
We must not be misled by the fact that
this quiet, unconscious action is not that of which
the world takes much notice. Men do not speak
of it, as they do of the striking and commanding
agencies which form so large a portion of the history
of the day. Some of these are powerful on a
wide scale, as in the case of a popular preacher,
or a great philanthropist. But the influence of
which we are speaking is exerted within narrower
circles. It acts, not upon the masses by wide-spread
impressions, but upon individuals by single
strokes; not upon the broad platform of public
enterprise, but within the more contracted sphere
of personal life. The supposition that it is feeble
on that account is a grave mistake. Our personal
relationships are more numerous and more continuous
than our public avocations, and it is in
the former rather than in the latter that we are
most effectually training our fellow creatures for
good or evil. Sometimes, too, this quiet influence
is brought to light with important results, as
when John Bright was discovered reading the
Scriptures in the cottage of a poor blind woman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
No public act of his&mdash;splendid as all his public
acts are&mdash;could furnish a truer indication of character
than this simple and, to most people&rsquo;s
eyes, this unimportant incident in his history.</p>

<p>That the value of direct influence in promoting
the well-being of mankind is incalculable there
can be no doubt. All our great undertakings&mdash;social,
political, and religious&mdash;are of this kind.
The progress which the world has made in every
right direction is greatly due to the combined
efforts put forth by societies or bodies of men who
have had truth to propagate, or blessing to diffuse,
and who have steadily directed their energies to
the end in view. Associations for Political Reform,
Temperance Societies, British Schools,
Ragged Schools, Sunday Schools, Tract Societies,
Missionary Agencies, Mothers&rsquo; Meetings, Church,
Chapel, out-door, and theatre services, are all of
this sort; and the harvest of good reaped from
them only God knows, at whose inspiration and
in whose name all good is done. Statistics tell
us much, but far more remains untold. All this
well-directed action is in accordance with the
Divine order. God wills that we should use
judiciously and zealously applied effort for each
other&rsquo;s welfare, especially in connection with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
spread of His truth. Every Christian agency is a
form of obedience to the great command: &ldquo;Preach
the gospel to every creature.&rdquo; Such action, moreover,
is in accordance with our convictions. We
<em>must</em> labour, formally and intentionally, on behalf
of any and every cause which lies near to our
hearts. Imagine all these direct agencies to be
suddenly and completely withdrawn&mdash;what would
then become of our poor world? Would it not
speedily lapse into a mournful, moral waste&mdash;a
training-school for present and everlasting perdition?
Multiplied and energetically worked as
these agencies are, the condition of the world is
bad enough. The appalling needs of the world
demand heroic effort; and, as I have said, the
amount of good already wrought by this is beyond
calculation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the other kind of influence&mdash;the
indirect and unconscious&mdash;is invested also with
an importance which is incalculable; and it will
be a blessed time both for the Church and for the
world when this truth comes to be practically
remembered as it should be. Let us consider this
matter a little further, bearing in mind, as we do
so, that the application of the subject must be to
the Christian conscience of us all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
I. Notice some differences between the two
kinds of influence which have been named.</p>

<p>1. We have already said the influence which
we consciously exert is the result of forethought,
and deliberately contemplates an end, the attainment
of which is steadily kept in view; whilst
our unconscious influence is spontaneous, and has
no premeditation or calculation about it. We
need only add here, that the action of this unconscious
influence is very immediate; a fact
which is explained by the mysterious insight which
enables men to look into, and to understand, one
another. We form judgments of men every day
without data that we can adduce. These judgments
are instinctive, and they are more frequently
right than wrong. How is it that we conceive a
sudden repugnance to one, and at first sight fall
in love with another? The impression made
needed only a word, a tone, a look, a gesture,
a smile, a tear; on so slender a basis a judgment
was formed which will last a life-time, or which
years will be required to modify.</p>

<p>2. Our unconscious influence is a perpetual
emanation from ourselves. Direct effort need not
truly express us at all. It may be imposed upon
us by circumstances which we cannot control.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
Often we should avoid it if we could. Moreover,
when it is voluntary and unconstrained, it is a
thing of times, seasons, places, and conditions in
life, and is therefore more or less fitful, partial,
and intermittent. The other kind of influence acts
continuously&mdash;without pauses, without breaks,
without paroxysms. It is thus that every man&mdash;high
or low&mdash;in spheres extended or narrow,
without intention, forethought or consciousness of
the fact, is always leading some one more or less
closely after him: it may be wife, friend, little
child, or stranger; but some one most surely.</p>

<p>3. This unconscious influence is necessarily
simple. It makes its appeal to all kinds of human
judgment, and to all degrees of human insight.
It is quickly apprehended, by the ignorant and
the young as well as by the learned and mature.
Many of our direct and most definitely-arranged
efforts are misunderstood. They tax people&rsquo;s
thought; they demand reflection; and they frequently
excite differences of opinion. How many
instances there are in which the most cogent and
strongly-urged arguments are lost, while the quiet
and undesigned force of example succeeds.</p>

<p>4. Our unconscious influence is the more powerful
because it excites no suspicion. It is intuitively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
felt to represent our inner self in the direction, and
within the range, of its present meaning. Many
of our direct efforts put men upon their guard.
If they are hostile to our intentions, they resist
our formal endeavours; if they are indifferent, they
become impatient of our zeal. But direct efforts,
moreover, are often thought to be mainly <em>professional</em>,
and this impression concerning them
places them at a disadvantage. On the other
hand, our unconscious influence wins men unconsciously
to themselves&mdash;wins them when they are
off their guard&mdash;and thus wins them in spite of
themselves.</p>

<p>II. How, then, does this fact of our unconscious
influence touch the question of our responsibility?
In what sense, and on what grounds, are we accountable
for it?</p>

<p>1. It is conditioned by our character. It reproduces
outwardly what we are within. If our
character, or, as the Divine Master terms it, our
&ldquo;heart&rdquo; be good, then our unconscious influence
must be good likewise; if our character&mdash;our
&ldquo;heart&rdquo;&mdash;be evil, our unconscious influence must
also be evil. As we are responsible for the motives
which actuate us, so are we responsible for every
form of conduct that proceeds therefrom. It must,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
of course, be admitted that even in a fundamentally
holy character there are ever and anon
exceptional mistakes, inconsistencies, and flaws.
How many of these, He only knows who forgives
all. But we are speaking of great moral tendencies;
and concerning these we are in no doubt. They
reveal <em>character</em>, and they share the responsibility,
in regard to their influence, which belongs to
character.</p>

<p>2. It is by this unconscious influence that we
act most on those who are nearest to us. Children,
members of our families, fellow-workmen, and acquaintances&mdash;all
these are much more affected by
the general tenour of our conduct, and the so-thought
trivial indications of our character, than
by our more formal efforts. Alas, it often happens
that these latter are made ineffectual by the operation
of the former. A practical inconsistency in a
parent&rsquo;s life at home will drive away from the mind
and conscience of a child the force of the best and
most frequently repeated precept. Even when
direct and well-meant effort is put forth, it is often
comparatively powerless apart from the help it
derives from the unconscious influence that accompanies
it. A smile, a look, a sigh, a tear, will
often put life into an argument which may be sound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
enough in itself, but which, without such an auxiliary,
would be dry, uninteresting, and therefore
ineffective. Is all this influence outside the range
of our responsibility?</p>

<p>3. Our indirect influence is our <em>truest</em>. It best
represents <em>us</em>. In formal effort, there is room for
a more or less transient enthusiasm, love of excitement,
love of applause, self-seeking, hypocrisy.
But our unconscious influence belongs to us at all
times&mdash;follows us, and is as true to us as the
shadow follows, and is true to, the substance.
We cannot escape from it. It proceeds from us
spontaneously, without our volition; and it mirrors
externally what we are radically and in the recesses
of our real being. If we be responsible for
what we really are, we must be responsible for the influence
we thus spontaneously and inevitably exert.</p>

<p>4. Another ground of this responsibility is that,
on reflection, we know that it is by these unconscious
exhibitions of character that the world is
constantly judging us. Often the judgment of
the world is harsh, and commonly uncharitable;
but it is shrewd, and generally there is a rough
justice about it which marks its worth.</p>

<p>These considerations, and many more that might
be adduced, show how solemn is our responsibility
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
with respect to the impressions we are constantly
and unconsciously producing on those around us.
As in nature, so in human life, the most unobtrusive
and silent forces are the strongest. The
nightly dew effects more good than the occasional
storm-shower, and light works more wonders than
lightning.</p>

<p>III. From all this we learn some weighty
lessons. It teaches us&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The importance of each act in our life.
The text before us is no exaggeration. Everything
tells, because there is character in everything,
and consequently <em>power</em> for good or ill. It
is impossible for any one of us to be in the world
without responsibility. There is no escape for
us. Simply to be <em>in</em> the world, whatever we may
be, is to exert an influence, subtle, quiet, powerful&mdash;an
influence compared with which argument and
expostulation and entreaty are feeble. We say we
mean well; we think that at least we are injuring
nobody and doing no harm; <em>but is it so?</em> It cannot
be so, unless our influence be always on the
side of God and of goodness. By looks, glances,
unpremeditated words and deeds, we are perpetually
exerting an influence which may turn the scale
of some man&rsquo;s eternal destiny!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
2. The necessity of conversion. If our unconscious
influence is to be of a wholesome kind,
we must undergo a radical moral change, out of
which will proceed an all-pervading sanctification.
Blessed be God for the revelation of the Holy
Spirit. Up to this point, the consideration of our
subject may have prompted some to ask: &ldquo;Are
we, then, to be anxiously, feverishly, incessantly
watching ourselves in order that we may make no
mistakes, and do no evil? Such vigilance&mdash;would
it not take all our time, and absorb all our strength?
Such a life&mdash;would it not be a terrible bondage?
Is it necessary?&rdquo; We reply, &ldquo;Yes, and no.&rdquo;
That is to say, there will always be the necessity
for watchfulness and prayer; but the true secret
of <em>doing</em> good lies in <em>being</em> good. The path of the
just is as a shining light; he shines because he is
luminous. The tree is known by its fruit; not by
the fruit which is tacked on, as in the case of a
Christmas tree, but by the fruit which is the
produce of the tree&rsquo;s own interior life. &ldquo;Out of
the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. A
good man out of the treasure of the heart bringeth
forth good things, and an evil treasure bringeth
forth evil things.&rdquo; Before a man can impart the
higher order of blessing to his fellow men, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
himself must receive the blessing of a new nature from
God.</p>

<p>The question is often asked why the triumphs
of Christianity are not more marked in the world,
and why spiritual growth is not more marked in
the Church. The answer is found partly, no doubt,
in the imperfections of the direct efforts which are
put forth with these ends in view; but not in these
alone. No small portion of it is to be traced to
the deleterious elements which mingle with the
undesigned influences which emanate from many
of the professors of Christ&rsquo;s religion. When Moses
was on the Mount with God, his face became
luminous. Was he conscious of its shining?
Not until the people were &ldquo;afraid to come nigh
him.&rdquo; Then he had to cover his face with a vail!
How few are &ldquo;luminous&rdquo; enough to need &ldquo;vailing&rdquo;
now!</p>

<i>SECULAR ANXIETY.</i></h2>

<p class="theme">&ldquo;Take no thought for your life.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Matthew</span> vi. 25.</p>

<p class="theme">&ldquo;Take no thought for the morrow.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Matthew</span> vi. 31.</p>


<p>Let us survey the entire passage of which the first
of these texts is the commencement, and of which
the second is the close. It brings before us a
common evil, and for this evil it proposes a
sovereign remedy.</p>

<p>The evil is <em>secular anxiety</em>. Perhaps we need
not be greatly surprised at its prevalence, when we
consider what the life-experience of most of us is.
Think of the uncertainty of almost everything we
know&mdash;life, health, friendship, domestic relationships
and affections, riches, commerce. Life has
many sad surprises and disappointments. Our
own day is especially full of care. The age is
mad with speculation&mdash;thousands making haste
to be rich, and so bringing upon themselves many
temptations. For many others, the time is full of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
hard necessities, and the outlook is one of possible
or even probable poverty. The admonitions given
by our Lord in the verses before us are needed
now more than ever.</p>

<p>There are persons who, under the influence of
pride and false notions of manliness, consider careworn
Christians&mdash;Christians labouring and struggling
amid the difficulties of the way&mdash;undeserving
of sympathy. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;what are
the ills of life, that we should make so much ado?
Be men!&rdquo; Sometimes we meet with superficial
Christians who profess that this life is really so
insignificant, that it shows a low state of piety to
be painfully affected by common ills. As to the
first, nothing but stoicism, or the hard-heartedness
which is sometimes the result of prosperity, can
make the soul unsusceptible to the ordinary
troubles of life, or independent of the antidote
which the religion of Christ supplies. As to the
second, do not let them talk in a way which implies
that they are wiser than their Lord. He knew
how heavily care pressed upon the hearts He loved,
and condescended to offer them the appropriate
and all-sufficient relief.</p>

<p>And how does the great Teacher speak to the
careworn in these verses? Is it not unspiritual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
to take arguments for the comfort of our Christian
life from lower things? Must we go to the irrational
and inanimate creation for gospels of blessing
for our spiritual need? Christ drew His
arguments from the birds and the flowers; clearly
showing that we should accustom ourselves to see
God&rsquo;s hand, His love, His teaching, in all things.
Let Him not be excluded from the least part of
His creation. Every part of it may subserve the
purposes of His grace. &ldquo;<em>Consider</em>&rdquo; the fowls of the
air and the flowers of the fields; make them objects
of study. To the thoughtful they often suggest
&ldquo;thoughts that lie too deep for tears;&rdquo; to the
Christian they may well suggest thoughts which
shall inspire thanksgiving and prayer.</p>

<p>Note the condescension, the simplicity, and the
power of our Lord&rsquo;s argument. His appeals are
homely. He seeks no far-fetched reasonings or
facts from antiquity. He points to birds and
flowers; an argument for simple people, but
equally effective for the learned and the refined.
We have no need to go far for lessons of comfort.</p>

<p>We must not overlook the necessary limitations
of our Lord&rsquo;s teaching in these verses. Those
limitations are found in the nature of things.
Observe, then,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
I. Christ does not forbid all anticipations of
the future. He cannot mean so much as this
when He says, &ldquo;Take no thought for the morrow.&rdquo;
Man is an inhabitant of two worlds&mdash;one material,
the other spiritual. This being so, two distinct
sets or classes of wants press upon him&mdash;the wants
of the body, and those of the soul. The wants of
the soul point to a future state of existence, for
which we must prepare. In relation to these,
carelessness&mdash;the absence of forethought&mdash;would
be fatal. According to the state of our souls, the
thought of the future gives us terror or joy. To
the Christian, the future is the scene of his perfected
spiritual growth, and of his consummated
happiness. Every aspiration of his soul bounds
joyfully towards it, and he instinctively leaves the
things that are behind to press forward. In the
words before us, Christ does not touch such
matters as these. It is not fore-<em>thought</em> which is
condemned, but fore-<em>boding</em>.</p>

<p>II. Nor does He discountenance earnest activity
in the duties of the present. Work is God&rsquo;s
oldest law. It is only in wilful blindness or in
unaccountable delusion that men can plead this
teaching as an excuse for indolence. &ldquo;If any man
will not work, neither shall he eat.&rdquo; Work is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
often spoken of as a curse; but it is a blessing.
With a Christian spirit, it may be gloriously consecrated.
It links us in our activity with God
who &ldquo;worketh hitherto,&rdquo; and with Christ who
worked His full day.</p>

<p>III. Christ does not even condemn a legitimate
forethought in connection with secular interests.
There <em>is</em> a legitimate forethought such as this.
Nature teaches it. We must sow in order to reap.
We must toil to-day for results which cannot
come till to-morrow. &ldquo;If any provide not for his
own, and specially for those of his own house, he
hath denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.&rdquo;
The faith to live by is that which
prompts not to sitting down and doing nothing,
but to trustful and persevering enterprise. Keep
in mind the distinction between forethought and
foreboding. It is forethought in a man which
leads him to sow for a future harvest; it is foreboding
that would fill his heart with fears that the
harvest will be a bad one. Forethought is the
grand distinction between the civilized and the
savage; foreboding is the weakness of distrust.</p>

<p>What the Lord bids us guard against, then, is
conjectural brooding over the possible necessities
of the future, and our possible lack of the resources
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
required for their supply. &ldquo;Taking thought&rdquo;
means giving way to anxiety&mdash;the constant occupation
and worry of the heart in looking forward,
gazing into, and dreading the possibilities of the
days and years yet to come. &ldquo;Sufficient unto the
day is the evil thereof.&rdquo; Be warned against forebodings
of evil to-morrow. The lesson is, &ldquo;Do
the day&rsquo;s work as it is appointed by God; accept
the day&rsquo;s mercy, bear the day&rsquo;s evil; and be not
anxious about the evil which to-morrow may
bring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How common a weakness&mdash;nay, rather let us
say, how common a sin&mdash;this taking anxious
thought for the morrow is! We see the lines of
care in thousands of faces every day. Anxiety has
marked its furrows round lips which every morning
say, &ldquo;Give us this day our daily bread.&rdquo; It is a
calamity as well as a sin. It disturbs the heart,
so that there can be no enjoyment of present
mercies. It adds to the present the weight of an
unknown but dreaded future. It paralyses religious
feeling, and checks religious activity. It
defeats its end by shortening the life it would
fain prolong.</p>

<p>Now Christ shows that this kind of anxiety
reckons falsely, because it is founded on a false
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
estimate of life; and He further shows that to
gauge our position aright we must reckon according
to the Divine thought respecting it. The
whole of the teaching before us on this subject
is perfectly plain, consisting of a few simple and
obvious points. We cannot hope, indeed, to bring
it within the understanding of the mere worldling.
The man who has no filial confidence in God has
no antidote for care. Anxiety can only be subdued
in the heart of him who can look upward,
and say, &ldquo;Father, I trust in Thee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>What, then, is the first point? It is this, that
God&mdash;the Author of our life, the Creator of our
bodies&mdash;will surely give that which, however
necessary, is yet less important and less valuable.
In bringing us into existence, He has done more
than He can do in giving to us any secular
blessing which we can need. &ldquo;Is not the life
more than meat, and the body than raiment?&rdquo;
We have our life from Him; our bodies are His
handiwork. Why should we suspect that He will
be indisposed to give us whatever may be needful
for the existence thus created? Will He, by
neglect, frustrate His own purpose? The greater
gift can only be sustained and made valid by the
lesser ones. Without food and raiment the body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
must decay, and its life must perish. God does
not give imperfectly.</p>

<p>Another point is this, that anxious care answers
no good purpose. It is useless. If we could by
means of it gain an exemption from future evil,
common prudence would dictate it as a wise
expedient. But it is not so. Christ puts this
consideration very strongly. No amount of foreboding
can add a single moment to our life, for
the boundaries of our life have been fixed by God.
The future is utterly unknown to us; and foreboding
will not help us in the least degree to forecast
its difficulties and its trials, though it may
unfit us for the endurance of them. Whether we
are cognizant of it or not, God will take His plan
with us, and will carry it out. If we could not
believe in the love that He hath towards us, the
thought of this would be a dark sorrow; but,
assured of His love as we <em>may</em> be, we can also be
assured that He will do all things well. At any
rate, no over-anxiety of ours will facilitate the
order of life we long for. &ldquo;The morrow shall take
thought for the things of itself.&rdquo; It will have
anxieties enough of its own in spite of every effort
of ours to set it free from them. Every day, to
the end, will have its own &ldquo;evil,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;evil&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
of each day will require all our strength for coping
with it. So that anxiety <em>for</em> the morrow will not
remove care <em>from</em> the morrow; it will only take
strength and joy from to-day. Trust in God, and
all that He gives you of trouble for to-day will be
accompanied by the gift of the strength necessary
to enable you to bear it. But do not expect Him
to give you strength to bear unnecessary sorrows&mdash;sorrows
of your own making&mdash;the sorrows which
spring from worldliness and unbelief. &ldquo;As thy
day&rdquo;&mdash;the day that now is&mdash;&ldquo;so thy strength
shall be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A third point is, that, reasoning from analogy,
we may be sure that God will provide for us. He
feeds the birds, and He clothes the lilies. They
can do nothing for themselves; yet how well are
they provided for! &ldquo;Are not ye much better than
they?&rdquo; A wonderfully simple, beautiful, and
effective argument this! How grand the view it
gives us of God&rsquo;s position in His universe! What
knowledge must be His! What power! What
vastness&mdash;what variety of resource! What
minuteness of kindly, loving interest! Who
would not gladly entertain such a conception of
God and of His Providence as this, in preference
to the atheism and the materialism which have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
intruded so grievously into the science of our
times? &ldquo;Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow
not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns;
yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye
not much better than they?... Consider the lilies
of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither
do they spin: and yet I say unto you, that Solomon
in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field,
which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the
oven, shall He not much more clothe you, O ye of
little faith?&rdquo; Thus, God is not content with
giving what is simply necessary for life; He gives
for <em>beauty</em> also. Showing His goodness in such a
manner to objects inferior to man, why should man
suspect that the same goodness will be denied to
<em>him</em>? Observe, that Christ does not teach that
birds and flowers are better than men because of
their immunity from toil. His meaning is, that
creatures which do not and cannot toil&mdash;creatures
which do not and cannot forecast the future&mdash;are
clothed and fed; will God neglect the nobler
creatures to whom He has given the power of
thought, and whom He has put under the
obligation to labour? Even with these higher
powers, man is still as dependent as any of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
inferior creatures around him. Will his needs be
overlooked, while theirs are supplied? Such a
question is all the more pertinent when we
remember, that whilst they live for a day, he was
created for eternity, and needs the special gifts
which can shape his present life into a preparation
and a discipline.</p>

<p>An additional point is, that unholy anxiety is
essentially ungodly, irreligious, unworthy of the
position and the professions of a Christian man.
&ldquo;Take no thought,&rdquo; no anxious thought, &ldquo;saying,
What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink?
or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? <em>For after
all these things do the Gentiles seek.</em>&rdquo; Anxious thought,
therefore, is the characteristic of heathenism, and
must be excluded from the religion which is true.
It is the spirit of the world, not the spirit which
is of God. We see this clearly enough when we
compare the amount of thought and care which
we bestow upon our earthly interests with that
which we devote to the interests which are spiritual
and eternal. What anxiety we give ourselves
about the future of our health, the future of our
business, the future of our worldly position, the
future of our children&rsquo;s secular education, the future
of their rank in society! Is it not ten times as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
great as that which we bestow upon our Christian
consistency, our religious usefulness, our growth
in grace? If we could hold the balance steadily,
which would prove to be the preponderating scale?
Our Lord puts the case in an indirect manner, no
doubt; nevertheless, it is impossible to avoid the
implied conclusion. That conclusion is this: &ldquo;If
you suffer yourself to be anxiously absorbed in
earthly things, you rank yourself with &lsquo;the
Gentiles,&rsquo; to whom this world is all.&rdquo;&mdash;Besides,
such anxiety is ungodly because it is <em>untrustful</em>.
Heathens, who cannot blind themselves to the
fact that their gods leave them for the most part,
if not entirely, to themselves, may be excused if
they feel that there is room, yea even necessity,
for anxious foreboding. But how different should
it be with those who know the one living and true
God, and who can recognize Him as their Father!
Surely He may be trusted as knowing His children,
recognizing their needs, loving them, and tenderly
caring for them. Taking anxious thought implies
the weakness, if not the extinction, of faith.&mdash;Moreover,
its impiety is seen in the fact that it is
a practical subordination of the spiritual to the
secular. &ldquo;Seek ye first the kingdom of God and
His righteousness, and all these things shall be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
added unto you.&rdquo; Let the most important things
have the first attention. Give due scope to the
higher aspirations of the soul, and the lower ones
will shrink into their due proportions, and will
take their proper place. God will give the earthly
as it is needed to those who first seek the heavenly,
and the true spirit of religion will make us rich by
making us content.</p>

<p>To Christians this teaching, taking it as a
whole, covers the entire ground of their secular
life, and much more than that. Look at two or
three samples of the cases to which it applies.</p>

<p>1. To personal secular positions. &ldquo;What will
the future be? Shall I live to be old? When
I am old, shall I be provided for? Will health
and strength be continued to me according to
my years?&rdquo; Leave that! Do your work <em>to-day</em>.
For this you may have the needful strength from
God. Do not trouble about anything further. Use
prudently the means which God has put into your
hands for providing for the future, and then commit
their safe keeping to Him. If you have no
such means, still trust. There are many promises
on which you may implicitly and calmly rely.</p>

<p>2. &ldquo;How about my children? Will they grow
up to be manful, good, godly; a seed to serve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
the Lord, and a generation to call Him blessed;
my comfort, my pride? Or will they take evil
ways; prove, like so many more, vicious, ungodly,
and bring down my grey hairs in sorrow to the
grave?&rdquo; Leave that! Do your duty to your
children to-day. Train them up in the nurture and
admonition of the Lord. Use a wise and godly
forethought on their behalf. Pray for them. Instruct
them. Set before them a Christian example.
You may trust the rest with God, calmly and
thankfully expecting the fulfilment of the words:
&ldquo;Train up a child in the way he should go, and
when he is old he will not depart from it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3. &ldquo;What about my religious future? If I
make a Christian profession, shall I be able to live
consistently with it? Shall I have strength to
resist temptation? What if I should fall? Can
I so live as not to dishonour the Church and
the cause of Christ?&rdquo; Leave that! Nurse your
Christian graces to-day. Lay up spiritual strength
in reserve. That is required by a wise forethought.
But having done so, leave the rest. God will take
care of it all. You may stedfastly trust that He
will gloriously complete the work which He has
graciously begun.</p>

<p>4. &ldquo;My Christian work&mdash;what about that?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
Shall I be permitted to go on with it for a few
years longer, and thus to have some opportunity
of realizing my ambition as a servant of the Lord
Jesus Christ? Or shall I be called away comparatively
early? And if so, what will become of
all the plans and projects upon which I have expended
so much thought and prayer and toil?&rdquo;
Leave that! Do your work to-day, and be not
anxious about the rest. When to-day merges into
to-morrow let the new to-day bring its own work
with it, to be done in the day. Nothing more of
solicitude than that is needful. You are not indispensable
to God; nor are you essential to the
work which by His will you are doing. If it be
worth doing, and you be separated from it, He will
find a suitable successor, or as many successors as
the accomplishment of the work may require.</p>

<p>5. &ldquo;How about the prosperity of the cause of
Christ in the world? Will it go steadily forward,
or will new and fiercer foes rise up against it?&rdquo;
Leave that! Do all you can for it whilst you are
here, and entrust the rest, as you entrust your
own work, to God. Do not hinder it by wasting
time in forebodings which ought to be spent in
service.</p>

<p>6. &ldquo;What of death&mdash;my own death? Shall I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
have grace enough to support me when the time
comes?&rdquo; Leave that! No doubt you will; but
do not be anxious about it. To-day you are &ldquo;the
living;&rdquo; be &ldquo;the living to praise the Lord,&rdquo; and
trust the needs of your dying hour to Him.</p>

<p>The words of Christ recorded in these verses
must have startled His hearers. They taught
new truth concerning life, and, beautiful as they
were, the truth they taught was strange. It would
have been so strange as to be without weight, if
He had not first taught equally new and equally
beautiful truth concerning God. How does Christ
here speak of God? &ldquo;Your heavenly Father.&rdquo;
The heathen instructors had not taught that!
Pharisees and Sadducees had not taught that! But
Christ was now in the world; He had come forth
from the Father, and He could say to men: &ldquo;Your
heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of
these things.&rdquo; Thus the whole teaching of these
verses on the subject of Providence and of Faith
becomes plain and demonstrative. The great requirement
is for us to love Him filially as He loves
us paternally; and then, from that point, all is
clear. We are dependent, but He will provide.
There are present difficulties, and probably there
will be future trials; but all takes the form of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
wise and holy discipline under His guiding and
beneficent hand.</p>

<p>How do we arrive at the conviction of the
Fatherhood of God? Sin stands in the way, and
conscience craves something more than a mere
authoritative announcement. Sin is the forfeiture
of all claim to the Divine favour. What right
have we to expect that His providence will be to
us a providence of love? There is but one answer:
to trust a God of providence, we must believe in
a God of grace. Paul puts the whole philosophy
of this in a single sentence: &ldquo;He that spared not
His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all,
how shall He not with Him also freely give us all
things?&rdquo; Our present subject, therefore, calls for
the gospel, and cannot be completed without it.
&ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the
sin of the world.&rdquo; &ldquo;He that hath seen me hath
seen the Father.&rdquo; And, &ldquo;If ye, being evil, know
how to give good gifts unto your children, how
much more shall your Father which is in heaven
give good things to them that ask Him?&rdquo; But let
us ever remember that we have higher wants than
those of the body. The soul needs food, and God
has supplied &ldquo;the bread of life&rdquo;; it needs
raiment, and God has given to us the robe of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
righteousness wrought by Christ; it needs a
home, and we have &ldquo;a house not made with
hands, eternal in the heavens.&rdquo; With these provisions,
then, shall we forecast the future with
fear, or with hope? Which shall it be?</p>

<h2><span class="smlfont">XI.</span><br />
<i>CONTENTMENT.</i></h2>

<p class="theme">&ldquo;Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned,
in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. I know
both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every
where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and
to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can
do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Philippians</span>
iv. 11-14.</p>


<p>My purpose is to define and to recommend the
Christian virtue of contentment. I shall endeavour
to show that its acquirement is a duty, and that its
possession is a joy; but I shall also have to show
that as a duty it is not practicable, and that as a
joy it is not attainable, except on Christian grounds.
I trust that all this will be made abundantly clear
by the following observations.</p>

<p>I. Let us glance at the character of the man
whose words are now before us. There is in the
words the ring of a high moral tone which is irresistibly
attractive. Yet the effect they produce
upon us must depend very much upon the kind of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
man who wrote them, and the condition or conditions
of life through which he had to pass.</p>

<p>We should be pained by such words as these if
they came from the lips of a man whom the world
would consider prosperous. When the conditions
of a man&rsquo;s life are easy and comfortable, to make
a profession of contentment would be an abuse
both of language and of sentiment. Such a case
is not one for content, but for devout and hearty
gratitude mingled with a sense of humiliation under
the thought, which ought to be present to every
such man, that he deserves no more than others,
though God gives him more than many others
possess.</p>

<p>We should think sadly of these words if they
came from a stoical man. Contentment is not the
listlessness of indifference. It is self-conscious,
and finds in itself its own joy. Indifference is
loss&mdash;deterioration. It implies the blunting of
sensibility. The heart that is callous to grief is
closed against gladness also.</p>

<p>We should pity the man who uttered these words
from mere weakness of character, devoid of aspiration,
enthusiasm, or resolve. In his case, content
would be mere good-for-nothingness. The world
is full of uncomplaining men and women who do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
not cry, not because they are content, but because
they are spiritless, and consequently because they
are crushed down and hopeless.</p>

<p>There are other circumstances which would disparage
contentment. We will not mention them
now; they will be suggested as we proceed.</p>

<p>Now Paul was every way the kind of man to give
the noblest meaning to the words we are considering.
His whole constitution, make, rendered him
susceptible of the highest earthly enjoyment.
Mentally, morally, and socially, he was prepared
to accept and to appreciate the best that this world
could offer to him. He had great powers of thought,
reflection, imagination, and will. He had great
tenderness and generosity of heart. Proofs abound
that his social instincts were full of life and strength.
He was pre-eminently a man to be touched by
kindness or unkindness, by gratitude or ingratitude,
by love or hatred.</p>

<p>And what was his experience? It was not the
one-sided experience of a man who has known only
one condition in life. On the contrary, he had
been familiar with almost the highest and the
lowest. On the one hand, he had enjoyed the love,
and the tender, fervent gratitude, of many of his
converts; and on the other hand, he could speak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
of the bad conduct, the ingratitude, and the vexatious
opposition of others. He had the manifold
sorrows of a martyr&rsquo;s life of bonds, imprisonments,
scourgings, and stonings, to which must be added
the prospect of a martyr&rsquo;s death. He was not a
man of one kind of experience only, to which habit
had accustomed him. He had known the terrible
alternations of life, and had learned to be content
under them all. &ldquo;I know both how to be abased,
and I know how to abound: everywhere and in
all things I am instructed both to be full and to be
hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreover, Paul was a man of prodigious activity.
Contentment is easy to a sluggish nature, but it
must have been a difficult acquirement to one in
whom brain, heart, hands, and all the powers of
life were continually on the move. Couple with
this incessancy of action the loftiness and ardour
of his aspirations. He was not only capable of an
intense enthusiasm in any work which he took in
hand, but his whole impulse was an energetic
straining forward and upward.</p>

<p>These considerations give something of <em>marvellousness</em>
to the contentment which the apostle here
avows for himself; and they suggest that it must
have rested on some underlying conviction&mdash;some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
established condition of soul which it is desirable
for us to discover and identify.</p>

<p>The language he uses is in the utmost degree
significant. There is no haste about it, nor is there
any exaggeration. It is the expression of the result
of a severe and protracted mental and moral
training, under the influence of the Spirit of God.
&ldquo;I have <em>learned</em>.&rdquo; The lesson has been a difficult
one, but I have mastered it. &ldquo;<em>I</em> have learned.&rdquo;
The &ldquo;I&rdquo; is emphatic. &ldquo;Whether others have
learned the lesson or not, <em>I</em> have learned it.&rdquo; The
apostle does not speak either hesitatingly or slightingly
of his attainment. Thus, when he says, &ldquo;I
know both how to be abased, and how to abound,&rdquo;
he goes on to use a word which means, literally,
&ldquo;I have been taught the secret,&rdquo; &ldquo;I have been
initiated into the mysteries&rdquo;&mdash;both of satisfaction
and of hunger, both of plenty and of want. Such
language implies that his contentment was one
which had not been easily acquired. He had not
passed into it by a single step only. I do not
suppose the process was a very slow one, but it
<em>was</em> a process. The lesson had to be spelt out,
word by word, often syllable by syllable, perhaps
sometimes with tearful eyes and a bleeding heart.
And so these words are a record of attainment such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
as this world cannot snatch. The man who could
so speak of himself was in possession of the best
knowledge. He had graduated and taken honours
in the highest university.</p>

<p>II. The practical importance of this lesson of
contentment must be obvious to all. Two considerations
will enable us to see its importance
clearly.</p>

<p>1. Our earthly life is a scene of change. No
position is secured to any of us in this world, nor
is it in the power of any of us to remain always,
and safe from molestation, in a coveted state of
action, or of existence, or of enjoyment. Some
men never get into a state of positive happiness,
and, in the experience of many, the transitions
from high to low positions are startling, romantic,
painful, mysterious. Events which men call accidents
are constantly changing the aspects of things,
and certainly the most marked characteristic of
our life is vicissitude. This is a truth which is
known and recognized by all, and possibly it is
one which is felt acutely by not a few who are here
at this time.</p>

<p>2. The changes to which we are exposed are
temptations to disquietude of heart, and consequently
to discontent. This is true in a peculiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
sense of those who look only to the present world
for satisfaction, but it is also true to a certain
extent of the Christian. And why? Partly because
he is seldom perfectly free from unworldliness of
desire and of hope; partly because he does not
always read aright the meaning of his discipline,
and keep in mind the truth that because it is
Divine it must be always wise and good; and
partly because he looks too much to &ldquo;second
causes,&rdquo; not only in disappointment and sorrow,
but also in success and joy, forgetting the hand
and the purpose of God.</p>

<p>So that a Christian who has passed through the
numerous and various vicissitudes of life, and
whose faith, like a tree in successive storms, has
gained strength from every blast&mdash;whose hopes
have brightened while the clouds of life were
lowering, and whose experience by discipline has
become enlightened, rich, and mature&mdash;is one of
the noblest, though, alas! one of the rarest, sights
in the world. Such a man was Paul in a pre-eminent
degree. Reverses did not sour him. He
had often to contend against the hostile hand of
his fellow man, but persecution did not embitter
him. He could retain through all his absorbing
interest in the salvation of human souls and in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
glory of God. His troubles did not shut him up
in himself. He did not always talk about them,
as though he wanted everybody to pity and help
him; on the contrary, he was a peculiarly brave
and joyful man. He looked upon joy not simply
as a possibility, nor simply as a privilege, but as
a duty, the neglect of which by a Christian was
shameful. He knew that whatever of earthly good
might slip away from him, or be snatched away,
there was something immeasurably better which
was his for ever&mdash;God, Christ, immortality, heaven.
&ldquo;Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or
famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?... Nay,
in all these things we are more than conquerors
through Him who loved us. For I am persuaded
that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
nor powers, nor things present, nor things
to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other
creature, shall be able to separate us from the love
of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>III. What has been said will help us to form a
true idea of the state of mind which the apostle
here avows for himself, and in doing so to avoid
some mistakes. We have seen that contentment
is neither stoicism, nor want of interest in life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
nor sluggishness of temperament, nor weakness of
character. We further say, that Paul does not
mean that he considers all conditions in life alike
desirable, that there is nothing to choose between
them, that it is altogether immaterial whether men
be well or ill, strong or weak, rich or poor, high or
low, masters or slaves. Paul was not insensible
to the advantages of outward comfort, or to the
disadvantages of poverty. Nor does he mean to
teach that a Christian may not use all means which
are intrinsically legitimate and right for improving
his condition, in so far as he has those means at
his command, or the possibility of obtaining them.
What he means is that his happiness is not essentially
dependent on external circumstances. An
illustration of Solomon&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;A good man is
satisfied from himself,&rdquo; he carries within him
everywhere the elements of his own well-being.
So that being the man he is, being the man God
has made him to be, being the man whom the
Holy Spirit is fashioning by His grace, through the
instrumentality of the discipline of life, with a hope
that does not make him ashamed, because he has
the love of God shed abroad in his heart by the
Holy Ghost given unto him&mdash;he is happy enough
even in the midst of privations and difficulties.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
His contentment is not indifference to his work,
but industrious fidelity. It is not the narcotizing
of aspiration; for a man may ardently aspire, and
yet be content until it is time to rise. Still less is
it complacency with his own moral and spiritual
condition, or with that of the world around him;
for he says that he &ldquo;forgets the things that are
behind, and reaches forth to the things that are
before,&rdquo; and he &ldquo;greatly longs after men in the
bowels of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; But with all his appreciation
of life&rsquo;s comforts, with all his aspirations
after personal perfection, and with all his longings
to be useful in his day, he is not disconcerted by
difficulties and disadvantages;&mdash;he has learned in
whatsoever state he is, therewith to be content.</p>

<p>We must guard ourselves, however, from applying
this example of contentment to troubles of our
own making. God entrusts every man, more or less,
with the means of blessing himself, and of maintaining
his own honour among his fellow men.
But by sin, or by mistakes of conduct arising from
a culpable carelessness, we may lose our position
of advantage; and when we do so, we are not
entitled to the comfort arising from the thought
that, as all events are in God&rsquo;s hands, we must
just take things as they come, and be satisfied!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
The sin which has brought mischief must be
deplored; its consequences must be accepted as a
Divine correction, and Divine help must be sought
so that the chastisement may be sanctified. And
if on the lower ground we become less worldly,
holier, and more Christ-like, God will have the
greater glory and will give the deeper peace.</p>

<p>IV. And now for the secret of the apostle&rsquo;s
contentment, and the lessons that we are to learn
therefrom for ourselves. Paul says, &ldquo;I can do all
things through Christ who strengtheneth me.&rdquo;
The language is peculiar; what does it mean?
It means that, in whatsoever condition he might
be, he had Christ for a Helper and a Friend; that
Christ&rsquo;s companionship with him was constant,
full, tender; that His sympathy was great, minute,
comprehensive, cheering, exalting, all-sufficient.
So complete was his identification with Christ that
he tells these Philippians that living or dying he
was Christ&rsquo;s. But how did this come about?
Once he persecuted the Christ whom he now
glorifies. And even now his happiness has nothing
of the <em>miraculous</em> in it. It does not belong to him
merely as an apostle, or in the same way as his
&ldquo;inspiration&rdquo; or other special, supernatural gifts
with which he is endowed. It is the work of God&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
grace&mdash;grace imparted to him through the same
channels along which it may come to us. The
secret is this: Paul was a Christian&mdash;a converted,
regenerated man, a believer in Christ, under the
influence of the Holy Ghost; and the result was
accomplished by such simple means as faith and
hope and prayer.</p>

<p>Paul had felt, as we all feel, that there is in man
a soul as well as a body, an eternal life as well as
a temporal. He had also felt, as we all feel, that
he was a sinner, condemned and hopeless before
that holy law which he had broken, and the judgment
of which he must one day meet. But, in
obedience to the message of the gospel, he had
accepted Christ as his Saviour, through whom he
had received the forgiveness of sins, Divine sonship,
and sanctifying grace. So that he had to
regard himself as henceforth under training for
heaven, the training administered by a Divine
hand. He knew that the present life, with all its
changes, was the thing that was wanted for his
spiritual education, that nothing was accidental,
that no changes were chances, and that all changes
made up one great organized system of discipline,
in which &ldquo;all things were working together for
good.&rdquo; Thus he could cherish in his heart a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
contentment which would cover all his experiences.
There are ills which certain men can bear patiently,
but a Christian contentment learns to bear all ills
cheerfully; unmurmuring and acquiescent when
sorrows multiply, and when mercies one by one
are taken away.</p>

<p>This contentment under Christian conditions
is a duty, not perhaps of very easy attainment&mdash;Paul
himself does not say that it is that&mdash;but it is
a duty, as being the natural fruit of faith and
trust. Every Christian should be able to say:</p>

<div class="cpoem25">

<h2><span class="smlfont">XII.</span><br />
<i>JOY.</i></h2>

<p class="theme">&ldquo;Rejoice in the Lord alway; and again I say rejoice.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Philippians</span>
iv. 4.</p>


<p>Whatever may be the impression produced by
these words, no one can read them attentively,
and be indifferent to the admonition they convey.
They speak to our most real life, a life of mingled
sunshine and shadow; and they speak in the name
of a religion which is divinely holy and solemn.
They have a marvellous power in awakening feeling,
and if we could but know the emotion they
excite in each of us, we should find them to constitute
a perfect test of our actual experiences, as
well as of our religious condition. In any religious
assembly, there must of necessity be two widely
different states of feeling. Some souls are happy,
and others are depressed. To the first class, the
words before us come with sweetness, adding joy
to joy; to the second, they come with pain, the
pain of contrast and of longing. Hence the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
question might be asked, &ldquo;To whom are they
addressed? Are they spoken to the happy alone?
Must they be suppressed when we speak to the sad
or to the miserable?&rdquo; They are addressed neither
to the one class alone, nor to the other alone.
They were spoken to <em>all</em> hearts in the Philippian
church, without distinction of condition; and without
distinction they are also spoken to us. If there
be any special stress in them at all, it is when
they are addressed to the sorrowing, as we shall
see by-and-by. The words themselves supply a
hint as to how this may be. The joy that is recommended
is &ldquo;<em>joy in the Lord</em>.&rdquo; It is therefore
a Christian joy; and those to whom the apostle
recommends it, whatever may be the diversity of
their circumstances, are first of all, last of all,
anyhow, under any condition, Christians. Paul
knows that joy is an inevitable consequence of the
possession of true Christianity in the heart, that it
is the natural outcome of Christian faith, that it
ought to be a pervading experience of the Christian
soul through all the forms and circumstances of its
life. And so he offers the same exhortation to all.
Nor is it a recommendation merely: it is a command,
and it strikingly takes its place among the
great Pauline precepts. For the proof of this, turn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
to these precepts as we have them at the close of
his first epistle to the Thessalonians. (See chap.
v. 14-22.)</p>

<p>No one will suppose for a moment that the exhortation
to rejoice can be applied in any sense to
unbelieving men, to men of the world, to the ungodly.
Granting that they have a joy peculiarly
their own, it is of such a nature, and is so conditioned
by the life of every day, that it would be
cruel to bid them &ldquo;rejoice <em>evermore</em>.&rdquo; The worldling
has too many disappointments, struggles, and
cares, for a permanent and unbroken joy such as
that. He may think himself fortunate for rejoicings
that come now and then! Besides, how could
Paul recommend a rejoicing which is not &ldquo;in the
Lord,&rdquo; which is the only rejoicing possible to the
unbeliever? Paul&rsquo;s joy is consistent with every
duty of the religion he preached; but to that
religion the unbeliever is opposed. His rejoicing
cannot be acceptable to the Lord. It is spurious.
It has no true, substantial source. To such a man
the apostle might rather have said, &ldquo;Weep!&rdquo;
Christian joy is an inheritance closely fenced
around; and hard as it seems to enjoy any good
things in which others cannot share, we must say,
&ldquo;Unbelieving men and women, it is not for you.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
The way here is through the strait gate, and along
the narrow road.</p>

<p>No joy can be &ldquo;joy in the Lord&rdquo; which does
not contain the following elements&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <em>Purity.</em> The objects that excite it must be
pure. It must be free from all carnality and from
all sin; it must spring from the soul&rsquo;s sympathy
with God, with His truth, with His goodness.
Holy in its objects, it becomes a sanctifying power.</p>

<p>2. <em>Calmness.</em> It is freedom from turmoil of
heart, from disquietude of life. It suffuses our
feeling and our conduct with peace&mdash;peace that
&ldquo;flows like a river.&rdquo; Hence, it is the condition
of a quiet, steady Christian experience.</p>

<p>3. <em>Seriousness.</em> It does not depend on self-forgetfulness,
or on a forced thoughtlessness. It is
deepest in the most reflective, and is strengthened
in all by an honest and habitual self-examination.</p>

<p>4. <em>Humility.</em> There is a sort of arrogance
and self-sufficiency in worldly joy. Christianity
puts man in his true place, and teaches him to
refer all his peace to God.</p>

<p>5. <em>Love.</em> Love to man and to God; the latter
as the natural effect of gratitude, the former from
deep pity for his spiritual destitution, or from
sympathy in a common experience of happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
6. <em>Permanence.</em> It is not a fitful, occasional,
moody thing. Secondary sources of joy may fail,
but God, the primary Source and Giver of all joy,
remains; and the relationship between the believer
and Him abides, so that the grounds of peace
and of hope are everlasting.</p>

<p>Now it is clear that these are not the elements
of a worldly joy. We do not care to reduce all
that joy to a common level, and to say that it is
invariably and equally destitute of all these qualities
of purity, calmness, seriousness, humility, love,
permanence. It is enough to say that it is not
&ldquo;joy in the Lord.&rdquo; It does not consciously or
actually spring from Him; it is not maintained
by communion with Him; and it does not pay to
Him its tribute of love, consecration, and praise.</p>

<p>This exhortation to Christian joy is one of the
most common in the writings of Paul. Happy
Christians may wonder why it is repeated so often.
Why urge it at all? Is it not the first, the necessary,
the constant result of faith? Why specially
insist upon it as a duty? If faith be weak, give
us reasons by which faith may be strengthened;
but, once in the conscious possession of eternal
life and of peace with God, let the results naturally
follow. Are they not sure to come?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
One would suppose so; but, alas! Paul knew,
and we have reason to know, that we are very
inconsistent! There is often a divorce between
our professed beliefs and the results that should
flow from them. Then, too, our faith is often unconsciously
held. It is too merely traditional; it
lacks freshness and vitality. We may well, therefore,
be thankful that God, who has given us such
motives for joy, should still recommend it to us.
Even with a very sincere faith may circumstances
arise which shall trouble our hearts. Our joy
is constantly threatened, and almost unconsciously
we sometimes come to feel that we have none. I
know many Christians of whom the last thing we
could affirm would be that they are joyful Christians.
Hence the exhortation. It takes the form
of a command. Why?</p>

<p>1. We owe it to the love and mercy of our God.
Joy is the sign, the expression, and the ornament
of gratitude. A faith without joy is an altar without
perfume. God&rsquo;s abounding grace realised in
the heart demands this return. If we be not
joyful, what does the fact mean? Do we lightly
esteem His great love? Are we afraid it may fail?</p>

<p>2. Joy is a means of <em>testifying</em> our gratitude.
Without joy, faith is barren and inefficient, or else
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
its fruits are rare and without savour. The gospel
represents good works as the fruits of faith, and
fruits grow not on the trunk, but on the branches;
and joy is one of these. A worldly joy gives vigour
to the heart in the pursuit of worldly objects.
Christian joy prompts the heart to devotedness to
God.</p>

<p>3. The world is mightily influenced by our
joy. The idea that religion is a sad, gloomy thing
is widely spread, and is a hindrance in the way.
Men know that our beliefs ought to produce joy,
and, if they fail to do so, they become themselves
discredited. A true Christian is really at the source
of all true joy. The world yields him most because
he is nearest heaven. <em>Joy is a proselyting power.</em></p>

<p>4. True joy cannot be imitated. The world&rsquo;s
gaiety is the effect of temperament and circumstances,
not of reflection; it repudiates and
shrinks from thought. Christian joy deepens the
more thoughtful men become. The grounds on
which it rests are felt to be the surer the more
they are examined.</p>

<p>Let us look at one or two more of the characteristics
of Christian joy.</p>

<p>1. It does not avoid contact with men, but it
can, if need be, live alone. It can flourish in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
heart that is alone with itself and with God, and
can find its food in meditation and prayer. It
blossoms where other joys fade.</p>

<p>2. It is devout. It loves the places where its
Author is worshipped, but it can sing its praises
everywhere. The heart in which it resides is a
temple. It sings even in the midst of cares and
tribulations, like Paul and Silas in the midnight
gloom of the prison at Philippi.</p>

<p>3. It is at the furthest remove from frivolity.
It rejoices in serious things, even in such serious
things as sorrow and death. It looks up and on
with hope. It rests in God. It knows that
Christ, its Source, can never be separated from it.
It thinks itself rich enough in the possession of
God&rsquo;s great love.</p>

<p>4. It triumphs over the hindrances by which
all other joy is thwarted. As to remembrances of
the past, all that needed to be forgiven <em>is</em> forgiven.
As to actual trouble, it can take hold of God.
As to forecasts of the future, <em>that</em>, in its truest
blessedness, is secure.</p>

<p>Who would not be a Christian? And who,
being a Christian, can refuse to be glad?</p>

<h2><span class="smlfont">XIII.</span><br />
<i>SICKNESS.</i></h2>

<p class="theme">&ldquo;Lord, behold, he whom Thou lovest is sick.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">John</span>
xi. 4.</p>


<p>Much contact with sickness of late has set me
thinking about it; about the place it occupies in
the Divine dispensations of our life, and the lessons
it may teach. The subject will find an easy
entrance into our meditations. Most of us have
known what sickness is, and all of us have in
prospect that which will prove to be our last.</p>

<p>In all the sorrow that affects the people of God
there is more or less of mystery, which deepens in
proportion as those who suffer become mature in
their Christian life, and advanced in holiness. Yet
there are some obvious truths in relation to it
which are not hard to discern, and to some of these
it will be profitable to turn our thoughts now.</p>

<p>I. Sickness, in common with all our ills, is a
solemn witness to the existence of sin. If we
trace it back to its first cause, we shall find it to
have originated in &ldquo;the transgression of the law.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
It would be contrary both to the letter and to the
spirit of the gospel to see in each sickness the
direct result of a particular sin. Yet cases of this
kind are not so rare as we suppose. Many men,
even professing Christians, suffer in consequence
of sins known only to God and to themselves;
secret luxuries and excesses, or a trifling, perhaps
half unconscious, with some of the simplest laws
of Nature. Let not this be altogether overlooked.
Moreover, whilst we are not at liberty to suppose
an immediate connection between some particular
sickness and some particular sin, there is a general
connection between sin and suffering. There would
have been no sickness in the world if there had
been no sin. There was none in Eden: there will
be none in heaven. Sickness is a witness to the
disorder which sin has created. The Christian is
a forgiven man, but the secondary consequences of
sin remain. In a sinful world, the sins of others
react upon him in various ways. He himself,
though forgiven, is not yet perfect. There will
always be enough of the sense of sin even in the
most devout heart, to bend the sufferer in humiliation
beneath the thought that in a thousand ways
he has deserved the discipline of sorrow.</p>

<p>II. Sickness, however, affords equal testimony
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
to the love of God. The Christian has ample
reason for knowing that it is a Father&rsquo;s hand that
smites, and that the blow is tempered with gentle
mercy. We suffer less than many have suffered
before: less than many are suffering now. The
Old Testament gives us some notable examples of
suffering&mdash;Job, David, etc.; so also does the New
Testament&mdash;Paul, for instance. And what were the
sufferings of these compared with those of Christ,
who wept and bled and died, not for Himself,
but for us? In all ages better men than we have
suffered more. Consider what we have deserved,
and what, but for the mercy of God, we must have
had to bear. If the sufferings of life are not worthy
to be compared with the glory that is to follow,
neither are they worthy to be compared with the
doom which <em>must</em> have followed, if God had not
loved us with an infinite and everlasting love. Nor
is it beneath the subject to mention the alleviations
which are granted to us, and which we must all
trace to the Divine Hand&mdash;sleep, the suspension
of pain, sympathy, and, most of all, the hopes of
the gospel. These are common-place considerations,
but we must entertain them, if our gratitude
and trust are to be strong and simple.</p>

<p>But we must enter into particulars a little further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
for the sake of evolving truth still more immediate
and personal.</p>

<p>III. Sickness is often a special grace from God,
and is a providential answer to the secret desires
of our own souls. Not, indeed, the answer we
ask, or the answer we expect; rather, indeed, the
answer we would gladly avoid: but still an answer.
The cardinal want of man is salvation. Who does
not know that sickness has often been sanctified to
that end? The cardinal want of the Christian is
sanctification&mdash;preparedness for heaven; and every
Christian knows how seriously this is impeded by
a crowd of difficulties, real enough, but which we
have a propensity to exaggerate; generally, the
daily occupations and cares of life&mdash;a family to be
provided for, a competency to gain, favourable
opportunities to be looked for and seized, daily
mischances, and the like. Meanwhile we are
conscious of our spiritual wants, and there is a
painful conflict between the claims which are temporal,
and those which are spiritual. How many
Christians are living a life of absorption in the
world, yet harassed with occasional regrets, fears,
desires, connected with better things? To these
sickness is a Divine reply. It is as though
God said: &ldquo;Dear child, I know thy difficulty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
Thou canst not of thine own determination leave
the world; come away now. Leave thy labour,
thy anxiety, thy dreams. Shut out from the world&rsquo;s
noise, listen to Me, to thy soul, to heaven, to
eternity. Not that thou mayest do thy duty less
faithfully do I thus check thee, but that thou
mayest learn the true subordination of things to
one another; not the spiritual to the temporal, but
the temporal to the spiritual. That is why I put
this affliction upon thee.&rdquo; Oh, verily, blessed is
sickness when viewed from the station where we
rest and refresh in the fevered journey of life&mdash;a
truce after battle, a parenthesis in life&rsquo;s tale, into
which God puts His own deep-meaning and gentle
word. Let us remember this for our brethren&rsquo;s
sakes and for our own.</p>

<p>IV. Sickness, as a special proof of God&rsquo;s love,
is charged with a mission to bring to us some
special gifts and graces. It is above all things a
means of blessing when we associate with it the
idea of discipline, however stern. There is not a
single Christian virtue that may not acquire
strength on a bed of sickness, and there are not a
few Christian virtues which probably must be
learnt there, if they are ever to be learnt perfectly
at all. Among these note the following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
1. <em>Patience.</em> This is specially the fruit of sorrow.
No soul can know what patience is until
it has learnt what suffering is. To this effect
Paul and James both teach, putting suffering
before the Christian as a veritable cause of joy because
it produces patience. How many elements
in sickness would be aggravated by the absence
of this beautiful grace! How quickly we come
to feel that all worry is useless, and that we must
simply wait the good pleasure of the Lord! How
commonly too, the existence of this virtue strikes
the beholder. It is not apathy, it is not stoicism;
it is submission. When the sickness is past there
will still remain much in life to try us; but if we
have learnt the lesson, we shall know how to
apply it.</p>

<p>2. <em>Entire dependence upon God.</em> This is sometimes
hard to realize in days of health and vigour,
but in days of sickness we feel that the sentiment
is impressed upon us with especial weight.
We know that it is He who casteth down and
lifteth up. We use means for recovery, and this
is right; but we learn that without His blessing
the best and the most skilfully applied of these
are of no avail. This sense of dependence on God
should be the habit of the mind; and having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
acquired it in sorrow we shall not repudiate or
forget it in joy.</p>

<p>3. <em>Unworldliness.</em> In a sickness which is protracted,
and the issue of which is uncertain, we
learn to put the proper estimate on things. We
find and we feel that we have here no true home
and no true satisfaction, and that we must look
above. At such a time we perceive that the <em>real</em>
is the <em>spiritual</em> and the <em>eternal</em>. As we groan in
this tabernacle, we obtain our true relief in the
contemplation of things unseen.</p>

<p>4. <em>The confidence of faith.</em> The possible issues
of our sickness are momentous, and the question
comes: &ldquo;Of what quality are my hopes? Is
the religion that has given me joy and strength
in health able to support me now?&rdquo; And how
often the blessed answer is &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; God gives us
strength equal to our day. The Father&rsquo;s smile,
the presence of the Saviour, simple trust in the
Cross&mdash;these are realized as they never have
been before. And if health should return, it will
be with the calmly, soberly delightful feeling of a
religion in the heart that has stood the test. This
is the experience of not a few whom I have known.</p>

<p>All this has a mighty influence on others besides
the sufferers themselves. They preach, and preach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
effectively, through their sorrow and the grace by
which they bear it, and get blessing out of it.
Thus their sickness becomes an occasion on which,
an instrumentality by which, God conveys the
blessings of His grace to their brethren.</p>

<p>To all of us, whether in sickness or in health,
the subject suggests some important lessons. It
suggests thankfulness for such health as we have.
Others are suffering: why not we? Multitudes are
languishing in pain to-day; most of us are well.
Let us bless God, and seek His grace that we may
use this gift of health, with all His other gifts, to
His glory. It suggests sympathy for those who
suffer. How dependent they are on our kindness,
our gentleness, our love. Let us give it to them
in full measure. Specially, let us give expression
to our sympathy for them by prayer on their
behalf. It suggests faithfulness to the vows
made in the time of our trouble. How much
holier would all of us be to-day if none of those
vows had been forgotten!</p>

<h2><span class="smlfont">XIV.</span><br />
<i>JESUS ONLY.</i></h2>

<p class="theme">&ldquo;And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man,
save Jesus only.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Matthew</span> xvii. 8.</p>


<p>The visible glory has vanished; Moses and Elias
have disappeared; the cloud is gone; the Voice
has been heard; and Jesus has assumed again
the form of His lowliness. A few moments ago
Peter, in a half-unconscious ecstasy, was saying:
&ldquo;Lord, it is good for us to be here: if Thou wilt,
let us make here three tabernacles; one for Thee,
one for Moses, and one for Elias.&rdquo; And now they
are coming down from the mountain to the turmoil
at its foot, and they who wished to tabernacle so
gloriously above must descend again to their
fishing-nets below. The change seems sudden and
sad. We feel inclined to exclaim, &ldquo;What a loss!&rdquo;
But though they come down, Jesus is with them.
Herein lies the substance of what I want now to
develop. Our life has its resting-places, exposed
to startling, rude alternations; but it has also, in
the midst of all, its grand solace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
I. The first of these truths is one of such common
experience, that we have no need to do more
in support of it than to point to well-known facts.
I shall try to generalize them by referring merely
to three points.</p>

<p>1. To our external personal circumstances.
Sometimes we are prosperous, cheerful, happy.
We say, &ldquo;The lines have fallen to me in pleasant
places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.&rdquo; Incidents
occur which seem to transform our ordinary life.
We succeed in our pursuits. We are in health.
Our domestic happiness is undisturbed. We have
been delivered from impending ill, and, instead of
suffering what we have feared, we realize more
than we have hoped for. We are thankful; we
are content; and we want to build our tabernacle
on the green mount of our prosperity.</p>

<p>May we not indulge this feeling without any
suspicion that our prosperity may too much absorb
and unspiritualise us? But the time for disenchantment
comes, and if we have grace enough
in our hearts, we find that a drawback is put in
the way of our fancied happiness, the tendency of
which is proving a strong temptation to worldliness.
And then, though we do not court reverses&mdash;for
they, too, have their temptations&mdash;we begin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
to feel that this position of fancied happiness is not
so perfect as we thought. Besides, the novelty
passes away, and the satisfaction becomes less.
We had forgotten our higher needs whilst we were
absorbed in our external well-being. And so we
come to acknowledge once more that this is not
our rest. Sometimes, too, a veritable reverse
takes place; like the disciples, we have to come
down from the mount. The alternations of grief,
disappointment, and care follow our joy, and we
get a further confirmation of the truth that there
is no resting-place to be found in any of the
circumstantials of life.</p>

<p>2. To our intercourse with men. We have
reason to be thankful for all the blessing which
reaches us through this channel, and especially so
for all sanctified human relationships. To men
of confiding, generous natures, it is natural to
repose in their contact with certain of their fellow
creatures. Some of our brethren wield a marvellous
charm over us. We trust their character;
we are not conscious of their defects; we are
entirely at home with them.</p>

<p>But here, again, we find that we must come down
from the mount. It would be a sad story if we
could all tell our surprises and disappointments in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
this matter. How many apparently beautiful
friendships have passed away! How many defects
have we discovered in those whom we have
implicitly trusted, when we have been brought
into a closer acquaintance with them? How many
have others discovered in us? Do we not see here
one reason why men become cynical and misanthropic?
The greater the confidence, the greater
the subsequent distrust. The greater the joy, the
deeper the grief which has followed it. Let us
thank God for the friendships that abide; but let
us remember that human love can never be a
perfect resting-place for our hearts.</p>

<p>3. To our Christian feeling. In the early days
of our Christian life especially, and often afterwards,
all seems to be &ldquo;transfigured&rdquo; before our
eyes. We see a new earth and a new heaven.
We breathe a life-giving atmosphere as we ascend
the hills from whence cometh our help. Moses
and Elias&mdash;the law and the prophets&mdash;have undergone
the same transformation. Desires which
are earthly have given place to desires which are
spiritual. We seem to be in closest contact with
the Saviour, and we pity the small pre-occupations
of the world. We say, &ldquo;Let us build here our
tabernacle, and rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
But changes await us! First the heights, then
the depths! To-day, the unutterable words from
heaven; to-morrow, the thorn in the flesh and
the messenger of Satan to buffet! The one is not
without the other. Hence the lesson comes home
to us: &ldquo;Do not depend too much on your heart-states.&rdquo;
These high joys seldom last long. Jesus,
so to speak, loses His splendour, and comes down
again from the mount, as a man, to His humiliation.</p>

<p>II. The facts I have adverted to are such as
only experience teaches. The prosperous and the
immature may suppose that I take too gloomy a
view of life. By no means. Life has brought its
trials to me; and, like many others, I have been
again and again on the mount to come down afterwards
into the valley. And, were it not for one
crowning consideration, there has been enough of
change to some of us to make us sad and gloomy
enough. What has prevented it? <em>This, that Jesus
has come down from the mount along with us.</em> We
have learnt to prize Him in proportion as we have
learnt the deceptiveness of all beside!</p>

<p>As Jesus humbled Himself, so He humbles His
own. He wants us to walk by faith, not by sight,
nor by sentiment. What should we become on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
our Tabor, if we were allowed to build our tabernacles
there? Certainly proud; perhaps foolish;
perhaps self-sufficient. Paul was in danger of
being exalted above measure by the glory of the
revelations which came to him; have we any
reason to be more certain of ourselves? The
greater the height the more destructive the fall.
We might also mistake religious ecstasies for
religious firmness or religious growth. Yes, the
true discipline is that which makes us come down.</p>

<p>All this looks like the disenchantment of our
cherished illusions. What have we to put in their
place? Man does not live alone by what is taken
away from him, but by what is given to him.
Have we taken away all? Have we given nothing?
We read that a Voice came out of the cloud,
saying, &ldquo;This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleased; hear ye Him.... And when the
disciples had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man,
save Jesus only.&rdquo; What does that teach us?</p>

<p>It teaches that out of these ecstasies, which often
hide the reality, there comes a gift of God more
precious than all&mdash;<em>Jesus Himself</em>. Whatever form
He may assume, He is still the same; still the
same whether He goes up the mountain with us,
or comes down with us from the mountain. Our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
illusions vanish, but Jesus does not disappear. It
is to Him that God directs us when the dreams of
life are gone. Events deceive us, men change,
the joy of our own hearts subsides; but these things
happen that we may lift up our eyes and see Jesus
only.</p>

<p>And so the illusions which depart give place to
a permanent good. Do not be afraid to descend
from the mountain-tops into the low valleys which
lie beneath. Neither height nor depth need separate
from the love of Christ. A mighty and gracious
Hand guides you, whether you see it or not. Lay
hold of it with confidence. Though your ecstacies
vanish, the great gain of your faith will be a sober,
deep repose.</p>

<p>Do not confound this repose with a want of
life or of interest. A staid, strong, sober Christian
is a man who has learnt in whatsoever state he is
therewith to be content. A staid, strong, sober
Christian is one who can do all things through
Christ, who is ever near and ever strengtheneth.</p>

<p>Is not such a condition a blessed one? It is
that which gives to faith its permanence and its
calm. Instead of ascending to heaven and descending
to the abyss to find Christ, we find Him
here, and remain with Him in peace and assurance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
Having found Him, and being united to Him, we
may, if need be, do without the rest. On the
mount and in the plain we have the same Saviour.
In any case, our hearts are on a sure foundation.</p>

<p>The tabernacles Peter wanted to erect on Tabor
let us erect in the valley. Let us keep near to
Jesus; near to His law, near to His promises, but
emphatically near to Him. This, too, will be a
transfiguration, the transfiguration of our common
life. The light of the Divine glory will shine about
us; and in the light, and out of the cloud, the Voice
will speak. We shall tabernacle with Moses and
Elias only above; but we may tabernacle with
Jesus below. Let us tabernacle with Him most
at the cross; for it is there that we shall find most
of our holiness and our hope.</p>

<h2><span class="smlfont">XV.</span><br />
<i>PRAYER.</i></h2>

<p class="theme">&ldquo;Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find;
knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that
asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him
that knocketh, it shall be opened.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Matthew</span> vii. 7, 8.</p>


<p>Prayer is one of the vital elements of the Christian
life. It mingles with its first impulses; it
is the secret of every step in its development,
the hidden germ of the grain of mustard-seed, the
sap that nourishes the growing and the perfected
tree from the furthermost fibres of its roots to the
topmost shoot of its branches. A sapless tree is
not a living one, but dead; a prayerless Christian
cannot be.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, the New Testament
is remarkably plain in its teaching on this
subject of prayer. The difficulties connected with
it which exist in our minds are not difficulties
which it creates or even sanctions. A simple
reverence for its utterances is almost all that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
need for their removal. Let us inwardly pray for
this while we study the question now.</p>

<p>The form in which our Lord presents His exhortation
in the text is interesting and suggestive.
He uses three words&mdash;&ldquo;ask,&rdquo; &ldquo;seek,&rdquo; &ldquo;knock,&rdquo;
which seem to intimate a gradation, and to lead
up to a climax. The word &ldquo;ask&rdquo; indicates the
felt want of a good which may be obtained; not
purchased, but obtained as a free gift. The word
&ldquo;seek&rdquo; indicates the continuance of the asking,
with the added idea, perhaps, that our need is our
fault, and that what we seek has been previously
lost. The word &ldquo;knock&rdquo; supposes a difficulty in
obtaining, the delay of the answer, a blessing shut
up, and not immediately forthcoming. Here,
then, is a hint of possible difficulties. Nevertheless,
a promise is annexed, which is all-sufficient.
&ldquo;Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall
find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.&rdquo;
Christ&rsquo;s word is assurance enough for us; but He
condescends to append an argument drawn from
a comparison between man and God, between imperfect
earthly parents and the infinitely perfect
Father in heaven; an argument which ought to
be conclusive. &ldquo;What man is there of you,
whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a
serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give
good gifts unto your children, how much more shall
your Father who is in heaven give good things to
them that ask Him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The facts as they lie open on the surface of the
text are among the most solemn and momentous
facts of our life and thought. There is a God,
holding in the universe a position which is exclusively
His own, the great and only Giver of all
good. Man&rsquo;s position is one of dependence; in no
sense is he self-sufficient. As it is God&rsquo;s prerogative
to give, so it is man&rsquo;s duty and interest to ask.
There is a possibility of communion between Him
who gives and him who needs; the hand of want
brought into contact with the hand that supplies.
Then we have the fact that God is both able and
willing to satisfy man&rsquo;s want out of His own fulness.
Further, we have the tender solicitation to
trust on our part&mdash;the absolute promise that such
trust can never be misplaced&mdash;and the encouraging
assurance that the God who gives is moved towards
His creatures who ask by all the sympathies of a
Divine Fatherhood. Every ground of the confidence
that children have in their parents is consolidated
into a rock of immovable repose when
the Heavenly Father comes in question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
These facts enter into the common substance of
our Christian belief and thought. As Christians,
we never deny and never dispute them. We hold
them in a measure unconsciously till the crises of
life bring them into prominence. But they are
inconceivably marvellous. As mere conceptions
they are grand; as realized grounds of hope they
are inexpressibly helpful. They are full of greatness
and tenderness. Each of us may say to himself:
&ldquo;My soul, with all thy manifold infirmities and
littlenesses, thou canst pray to the great God!
Ay, thou canst come to Him as to an infinite
Father!&rdquo; Surely that is distinction and consolation
enough.</p>

<p>Comparatively few Christians, however, understand
prayer as they should&mdash;either as a duty or
as a privilege. With tens of thousands amongst
them it is to a great extent an unappreciated boon.
Even many devout Christians&mdash;anxious to use it
to more effect&mdash;have their difficulties. I want to
offer some help to such as these. The scope of
prayer, unanswered prayer, delayed answers, etc.,
all are subjects of anxious questioning.</p>

<p>I. Prayer, according to the teaching of Scripture
and of experience, is a simple transaction of asking
and receiving. It indirectly serves other ends, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
we shall see shortly; but it is first of all, and all
through, just what I have stated. We pray because
we want; we pray in order to get what we want;
and we pray with the feeling that we shall not get
it unless we pray. There is no mystery in such a
view as this. The transaction between the Christian
and God, involved in prayer as thus described,
is as natural, as simple, as well defined, and as
easily understood, as the action of a child when it
asks its parents for what it needs, and when its
parents give what it needs in answer to the asking.
The holy men of Scripture understood prayer in
this way. Their prayers are full of simplicity,
both as to their structure and their spirit. Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Samuel, Elijah, all
simply asked for such blessing as they felt they
needed; asked for the sake of receiving, and feeling
that the reception of what they wanted was dependent
upon their asking. They unquestionably
believed in an invisible Hand, and felt that the
Heart that guided that Hand delighted to be
trusted and appealed to in every, and for every,
kind of human need.</p>

<p>II. The simplicity of their view of the <em>nature</em> of
prayer is no greater than that of the view they took
of the <em>scope</em> of prayer. A feeling has grown up in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
the minds of many that we cannot ask with confidence
for temporal blessings, and that the only
blessings for which we may be sure that it is right
to ask are those which are spiritual. But that
was not the idea of the praying men of the past.
There was not a blessing, material or spiritual, for
which they hesitated to pray&mdash;life, health, food,
rain, fruitful seasons, success in battle, peace of
soul, forgiveness of sins, strength for holy work&mdash;all
these, and indiscriminately as to any special
privilege attached to the prayer for one or another.
Just so taught Christ. &ldquo;The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer&rdquo;
asks not only for the glory of God and the forgiveness
of trespasses, but also for &ldquo;daily bread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These considerations must neither be misunderstood
nor overlooked. Prayer is a direct, specific,
simple act. Men say that well-wishing, right-living,
work, and such like, are prayer. Not so.
A prayerful spirit may be, and ought to be, blended
with the whole of our life; but we must not so
shade off the act into something else as to take
away its point and its reality. Prayer is the concentration
of the soul upon its present need, whatever
that may be, and then bringing it to God,
naked and undisguised, for Him to meet it. The
faith that prompts and backs up such prayer hangs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
every circumstance of life, the most minute and
the most momentous alike, on the direct and immediate
control of God, in whose great foresight
all our little plans are lost, and in whose hands we
become the instruments of our own well-being.</p>

<p>III. It is demanded by such a view of prayer as
that which has now been given, that we should
confidently expect the answers to our petitions.
This seems a simple, trite thing to say; but it is
here especially that we fail. The attitude of looking
for answers to prayer is not a common one. How
is this? Partly because our prayers are often so
vague that we do not know precisely what to
expect; partly because the habit of prayer is
largely formal&mdash;a mere piece of religious routine;
sometimes because we misapprehend the form in
which the answer may come; and sometimes
because, in impatience, we lose heart and hope.
We should ever remember, however, that the
promise to hear and to answer is positive and unrestricted.
This fact leaves ample room for the
truth, which we should also ever remember, that
the mode and time of the answer remain with God,
and must be left to His loving wisdom. If He
should see that what we ask will strengthen our
faith in Him, bring our hearts nearer to Him, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
help us to fulfil His will, He will grant the answer
directly, and in the form in which we look for it.
He has done so in numberless cases. Sometimes
He does so in special and unmistakeable instances,
of which, perhaps, George M&uuml;ller and his orphanage
is the most prominent in our time. On the
other hand, if He should see that an answer of this
kind would encourage worldliness, or in any way
lead to evil, as it might sometimes do, then He will
delay the answer, or will change its form into one
of greater safety for us, at the same time speaking
with His &ldquo;still small voice&rdquo; words of peace to our
hearts. One thing is certain; namely, that if the
worldly advantage be first in our view, it will be
well for our prayer to be denied, and God will
deny it.</p>

<p>IV. One condition, then, of answered prayer is
that we must be loyal to God, and this loyalty
includes submission to His will&mdash;a willingness to
receive, and a willingness to be denied. We may
ask what we will in such a spirit as this; for in
such a spirit we shall be sure that any refusal
from Him will be a blessing to ourselves.</p>

<p>V. One difficulty in relation to prayer of which
anti-christian people make much, and which often
occurs even to the most devout, is as to how these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
specific answers to prayer can be made to agree
with the regularity of God&rsquo;s laws and the order of
His Providence. This question introduces us to
a mystery which we cannot hope fully to solve.
We have no idea that prayer alters either the
perceptions or the will of God; neither do we
imagine that it interferes with natural laws, so as
to prevent their due and natural operation. The
operations of nature are often affected by the
human will, both directly and indirectly; yet no
one supposes that to that extent the order of
nature is disturbed. Why may not the influence
of the human will upon nature act through the
medium of prayer to the great Author of nature,
as well as in any other way? No objection of this
kind lies against prayer which does not equally
lie against all human enterprise; yea, even against
the daily work by which we live! It is a sufficient
reply to every objection of this kind that it is
founded in a philosophy of fatalism. Surely if
man, within the limits of his power, can use nature
for himself, God, whose power is infinitely greater,
can use nature for him, if He be pleased on any
terms to do so; and there is no more interference
with the order of nature in the Divine use of it
than there is in the human. Prayer may have its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
part to play in the great system of causation as
well as work. It may be a part of the foreseen
chain of causes and effects by which God unfolds
His eternal purposes. The good order of a family
is not disturbed by the margin given to the children&rsquo;s
wishes and requests; and when we are
wise enough to know, we shall see how it has been
even so in the greater family of God. God is love
before we pray as well as when He answers; and
yet it may be according to His will, because it is
according to His beneficent wisdom, that there
shall be many blessings unreceived by us until we
ask for them.</p>

<p>VI. How do these thoughts bear upon the
subject of importunity in prayer? Such importunity
is not discountenanced, but rather encouraged,
by the very form of our Lord&rsquo;s exhortation. &ldquo;Ask;
seek; knock.&rdquo; I have said that this series of
words intimates a gradation, and constitutes a
climax. Seeking is more than asking; knocking
is more than asking or seeking. &ldquo;Ask and ye
shall receive.&rdquo; Yes, but the &ldquo;asking&rdquo; which is
to be followed by receiving may be such as to
include both &ldquo;seeking&rdquo; and &ldquo;knocking.&rdquo; God
is not reluctant to hear and to answer; but that
is no reason why He should not require sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
to be importuned. Christ gives His special sanction
to this importunity through the medium of
two parables, both of which were spoken for the
express purpose of urging it. The first of these
is the parable of the man who disturbs the repose
of his friend at midnight for the purpose of obtaining
from him the means of showing hospitality to
an unexpected wayfarer; the second is the parable
of the injured widow and the unjust judge. In
both these parables, the suppliants are represented
as prevailing; but the point to be noted is that
the power by which they prevail is their earnest
and persistent importunity. Why does Christ
illustrate prayer to God by the pertinacity which
is needful to arouse the affections of sinful man?
We may be sure that He does not ascribe any
thing of human imperfection to God. Our Father
in heaven slumbers not, and is never weary. He
is love. Christ simply puts Himself in the feeling
of the man who knows by experience that God
often delays the fulfilment of prayer, and shows,
by parabolic teaching, that to pray well we must
be fervent and not &ldquo;faint.&rdquo; The lesson is impressive.
If between man and man importunate
prayer prevails, how much more will it prevail
with God who is perfect, and who will not make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
us wait except for the sake of our highest well-being.
The man goes to his friend with confidence
because he has faith in the friendship; how inconceivably
strong may this confidence be when
we repose it in God! The plea was the stress of
his need; the same stress belongs to many of the
needs which only God can supply. Our praying-time,
like that of the friend at midnight, is often
that of the deepest darkness; but we pray to God
and not to man, and need not fear that He, in
His deep, heavenly repose, will fail faithfully to
hearken to our supplications&mdash;supplications which,
because they proceed from the holiest solicitudes
of love and duty, are inspired by Himself. Christ
bids us reason from both bad men and good men to
God, and it is well for us that He does so. On
the bad side, man&rsquo;s love is weak, his judgment
faulty, and his selfishness deep-rooted; God is
infinite both in His wisdom and His love. On the
good side, earthly fathers give bread, not stones,
to their children; how much kinder is He to
whom we look up and say, &ldquo;Our Father which
art in heaven&rdquo;! &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;He is good
and kind; but He makes us wait.&rdquo; It is so; and
why? We are feeble in our desires, and changeful
in our purposes. We soon give up. We want
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
faith, patience, perseverance. The uniformly immediate
fulfilment of our petitions would leave no
room for the cultivation of these quiet, unobtrusive
virtues of the Divine life within us. God makes
us wait, that we may become importunate, and
that importunity may nourish the virtues which
are as yet too feeble. Besides, delay gives purity
to our motives, and intensity to our desires. A
blessing which is easily won is likely to be unappreciated.
God would not have us treat His gold
as though it were stones. Delay is not refusal;
it is discipline. Moreover why speak we of delay
at all? What we so designate is not delay from
the Divine point of view. He never postpones
any asked-for good for one moment beyond the fit
time for bestowing it.</p>

<p>VII. What, then, is the character of the prayer
which avails? That some prayers are &ldquo;hindered&rdquo;&mdash;so
hindered as to be unsuccessful&mdash;we know full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
well. This may be accounted for partly by mistaken
notions about the Scripture theory of prayer.
For example, Jesus says, &ldquo;What things ye desire,
when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and
ye shall have them.&rdquo; The teaching of these words
is that the inspiration to true prayer is God&rsquo;s
pledge of the blessings sought, and that we must
be prepared to take it as such. The prayer of a
man who has not full faith in prayer falls short of
its mark. Hindrance may also arise from mistaken
notions as to the primary use of prayer. Prayer
is not an end in itself, but a means to an end. It
is true that the holier we become the more shall
we find ourselves accustomed to an atmosphere of
prayerfulness as the normal condition of the soul.
But we shall not pray aright, if we pray under the
impression that we are holy because we pray. We
must rather pray in order to be holy. The hindrance
may also arise from the absence of a supreme
anxiety and of a constant effort to honour God in
all our relations. Peter speaks of obedience to
the duties which spring from the conjugal relation
as being necessary to prevent the &ldquo;hindrance&rdquo;&mdash;the
ineffectualness&mdash;of family prayer. This is but
a special application of a great general principle&mdash;namely,
the connection between holy conduct in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
society and the efficiency of our social devotional
exercises. These two act and re-act upon each
other. To secure the true, full benefit of prayer,
we must strive to live holily in all the society with
which we mingle. This point touches upon the
value of intercessory prayer. Suppose that there
is a want of correspondence between the interest
in the welfare of those around us which we express
in our prayers on their behalf, and that which we
show in our intercourse with them; can we rightly
expect such prayers to prevail? The deficiency is
too frequently manifest in our relations both to the
Church and the world. How often is Church
brotherhood nominal rather than real! How many
pray for the salvation of souls, without caring to
do anything else! There is one thing which will
always, in so far as it exists, be a barrier to the
acceptableness of prayer, and that is the wilful
and persistent violation of any of the Divine commands&mdash;the
refusal to perform Christian duties
incumbent upon us, or the cherishing of some
habit or propensity known to be wrong. &ldquo;If I
regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear
me.&rdquo; The success of our prayers does not depend
upon our learning, or upon the skill with which
we can express our petitions, or with which we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
can string them together. It depends rather upon
the state of our hearts&mdash;the vivid consciousness of
need, the deep feeling of dependence on God, the
supreme desire of the heart to be right with Him,
faith in His promises, trust in His power and His
love, gratitude for His goodness, an unfainting
perseverance in appealing to His throne, and a
willingness to wait His time for the blessings thus
humbly, trustfully, and earnestly sought. These
are the elements of the true spirit of prayer.
&ldquo;Ask&rdquo; thus &ldquo;and it shall be given you;&rdquo;
&ldquo;seek&rdquo; thus, &ldquo;and ye shall find;&rdquo; &ldquo;knock&rdquo;
thus, &ldquo;and it shall be opened unto you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I alluded in the beginning to the indirect effects
of prayer, and these are too valuable to be overlooked.
Prayer, pervaded by humility and trust,
is always strengthened by its own exercise. All
Christian graces are beautified by it; all Christian
virtues are stimulated by it. It is a Divine provision
for rousing the slumbering affections of the
renewed heart, and keeping them awake. Prayer,
too, is its own reward, and a blessed one. How
holy and how happy must they be who are on
intimate terms with God! Their faces catch His
glory, and their every tone and step the impress of
the sanctity of the Divine companionship. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
Christian can tell his Father all! And because
he is so near to God and to heaven, he can put
and keep the world beneath his feet.</p>

<p>Even delays and seeming refusals are not without
their salutary influence. Some persons pray
for specific blessings year after year&mdash;&ldquo;pray without
ceasing&rdquo;&mdash;and are often staggered at the fact
that their prayers remain unanswered; and yet we
see them growing in spirituality, purity, fortitude,
faith, and we hear them say, &ldquo;Though He slay
me, yet will I trust in Him.&rdquo; And so their faith&mdash;the
most precious thing they have&mdash;is tried and
refined as in a furnace. Surely such an answer to
prayer is sublime!</p>

<p>I have been speaking to many a doubt, to many
a perplexity, with which I am familiar in my own
experience and in that of others. God grant that
my words may be helpful! What we all want in
regard to this great subject is clearer views and a
more unquestioning trust. God courts our utmost
confidence, and He will not fail to reward it.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="smlfont">XVI.</span><br />
<i>ASSURANCE.</i></h2>

<p class="theme">&ldquo;I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that
He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him
against that day.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">2 Timothy</span> i. 12.</p>


<p>These are among the last words the apostle wrote.
He is now at Rome, in prison, and within a few
days of the tragic end. He is worn down by age;
still more so by a constant, toilsome, suffering
ministry of some thirty years, a ministry which
has obtained for him, at the hands of men, stones
and stripes, and now a dungeon, with the immediate
prospect of a violent death. He is bound
with chains, and compelled to be silent just where
and when he has so long been anxious to speak,
in the metropolis of the world! He is, moreover,
forsaken by his friends, who, though they love him,
have not courage to go and visit him now! Outwardly,
no sadder condition could well be imagined.
Yet Paul is filled with a deep and holy peace.
How is this? The answer is that he feels within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
himself the approval of his God. He is in prison,
but that is because of his obedience to His Saviour.
He has worn himself down in a Divine service.
Behind him he sees a long train of woes and sufferings,
but he also sees many churches which he
has founded, and many unknown regions open to
the gospel. Before him he sees an unrighteous
judge and a painful martyrdom, but he also sees
heaven, Christ, and the unfading crown. If he
says, &ldquo;All have forsaken me,&rdquo; he can also say, as
his Master did, that he is not left alone. All this
is enough to account for the calmness and hopefulness
of this his last epistle, and especially of
the words before us to-day.</p>

<p>I will not trouble you with the critical difficulties
of the text. On only one preliminary question I
would say a word. What does Paul mean by the
expression, &ldquo;that which I have committed unto
Him&rdquo;? Some urge that it was the Church which
he was about to leave; others, that it was the
result of his labours; and others, that it was his
final salvation. I prefer to combine all these into
one general whole, and to say: &ldquo;All his Christian
interests, the hopes on which his spirit rested for
his personal salvation, and every other interest
that was dear to his heart.&rdquo; He had &ldquo;committed&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
to Christ himself, the church he had loved and
served, the results of his labour, and the final
reward to which he was looking forward. If,
within the vast scope of his desires, there had been
one thing which he could not commit to Christ,
his rest would have been incomplete, and his joy
would have been marred. But for <em>everything</em> he
was able to say: &ldquo;Saviour, I have committed this
to Thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Observe how Paul puts this great matter. He
was the greatest <em>doctrinal</em> writer of the New Testament;
but he does not say that he believes in
<em>doctrines</em>, but that he believes in a <em>Person</em>. &ldquo;I
know <em>whom</em> I have believed.&rdquo; All doctrinal belief
follows, and is comprised in, that. Faith everywhere
in Scripture is confidence in Christ. He
who believes in Christ must come sooner or later to
believe in the doctrines which cluster around Him.
But our experience grows beyond these into the
realisation of Him as being so actual, so near, and
so sufficient, as to be our true rest. Who among us
can tell <em>all</em> the reasons why he believes in Christ?
Many of them cannot be put into words. They
belong to our most secret thoughts, to the emotions
of our happiest hours, to a hidden, silent history,
which, if the world heard, it could not understand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
Yet these proofs multiply in proportion as the
Christian advances in life. How many times have
we found the words of Christ adapted to our
wants! How many unexpected deliverances has
He wrought on our behalf! How many answers
to prayer have we received at His hands! How
much peace has He breathed into our hearts!
&ldquo;I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded
that He is able to keep that which I have committed
unto Him against that day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What a grand confirmation have we here of the
faith Paul preached! Had his trust been misplaced,
surely he had suffered enough to disabuse
him of it, and that most completely. But his faith
grows the more he suffers. No mere party zeal
could stand a test like this; no, nor any delusion
either. And so we say that such a man as Paul
was, under the circumstances in which he maintained
his trust, could not be deceived. Thus
Paul&rsquo;s faith becomes a confirmation of our own,
and, with him on our side, we may face a world
of doubt.</p>

<p>But I wish to use the text chiefly for the elucidation
of a single subject. Paul&rsquo;s words express
<em>the assurance of his faith</em>. How does this subject
strike us? Does not the very mention of it give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
rise to sad reflections in many hearts? &ldquo;The
assurance of faith.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah, I knew it once,&rdquo; we
say; &ldquo;it was the experience of earlier days, and
has been the experience of some special days since
then, still more so of some specially holy moments.
But it is not my normal state. Would it were!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We are living in a period in which there seems
to be a general disinclination towards whatever is
firm and precise in religious creed, feeling, and
life. This may not be an altogether unhopeful
state of things. Respect for truth may keep some
minds silent concerning their beliefs, or at least
may prevent them from avowing those beliefs too
dogmatically. Anxiety and doubt may even in
some cases be a sign of spiritual earnestness. Yet
the tendency we speak of is on the whole to be
deeply deplored. The truth is that the world has
invaded us. Men shrink from great precision of
conviction because they shrink from great consecration
of life. How few the lives that are pre-eminently
Christian, as Paul&rsquo;s was! On the other
hand, our day is remarkable for its craving for
mere religious excitement. In many cases, it is
not so much the desire for truth, as the desire to
be excited and pleased, that prevails. Neither of
these tendencies can build up the faith which finds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
its grand avowal in the words: &ldquo;I know whom I
have believed, and am persuaded that He is able
to keep that which I have committed unto Him
against that day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The remedy for the state of things upon which
I have touched cannot now be pointed out, because
it would lead me away from my purpose. But I
want to show the effect of it upon ourselves, and
upon those who are without. There are certain
aims common to the Christian life of all of us, and
these cannot be reached so long as our faith lacks
steadiness and stability.</p>

<p>1. Our great mission is to convert souls. We
are avowedly the instruments of the Spirit of God
in this momentous work. But what is the conversion
of a soul? It is a radical change in its
affections and its life. But this change never takes
place apart from the influence of deep convictions.
Men will not exchange the known for the unknown:
actual life with its passions and its pleasures for
the weak and cold abstractions of a faith with no
precision in its principles, or for the worship of a
God who is vague and problematical. How are
we to succeed in winning souls to the truth we
profess unless we can produce something which
ought to convince them that we have the right of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
it? An unstable faith will be of little use to us
here. There must be no hesitation in our avowal
that our transition from the world to God is a
blessed one. In other matters, a man of strong
beliefs has half won us to his side. In religion, it
is notoriously so. Paul&rsquo;s grand words have been
a source of strength to us. Let us make them our
own&mdash;the expression of our own faith&mdash;and they
will become, through us, a source of strength to
others. Let us have this same Christianity in its
fulness and its power; and having it, let us avow
it without timidity and without reserve.</p>

<p>2. Our personal obligation, as Christians, is to be
holy; and we want the assurance of faith for that.
We may be deceived about our conversion. At
the outset of our Christian life we may be the
subjects of many illusions. But men are not mistaken
when, day by day, they are fighting their
passions, bringing the will into subjection, conquering
the flesh, and submitting the whole life to
the long, slow, toilsome discipline of obedience.
This kind of work is never accomplished by a
vague and undecided religion. Men do not deny
themselves without an equivalent. You cannot
persuade them to give up their illusions, their
pleasures, their passions, nor even their vices,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
unless you show them something else which may,
must, and ought to take their place. If you empty
the heart of one set of elements, you must fill it
with another. So it is that we want a living God,
a living Christ, close to us; loving us, forgiving us,
helping us, comforting us, and opening before us
the prospect of glory and of happiness for eternity.
Let us know and feel ourselves able to say, &ldquo;I
know whom I have believed, and am persuaded
that He is able to keep that which I have committed
unto Him against that day,&rdquo; and the
struggle with inward evil will be simplified, and
will become comparatively easy.</p>

<p>3. We stand in daily need of strength and
consolation, and for that nothing but a firm and
settled faith will suffice. There are great sorrows
and great anxieties to which we are all exposed,
in the face of which nothing will do for us but
sovereign words of life and of hope in which we
can implicitly trust. There are great wrongs
under which we cannot be comforted except by the
constant conviction of a righteousness which will
one day vindicate the right, and redress the wrong.
There are great losses in which we want the
promise and the certainty of an immense and restoring
love. Souls will seek this strength, this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
consolation, here, there, everywhere; but they will
never find it until they can say, &ldquo;I know whom I
have believed, and am persuaded that He is able
to keep that which I have committed unto Him
against that day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>4. The assurance of faith is necessary to all
earnestness of effort in the spread of the gospel.
A church or a Christian, subsiding into uncertainty
of religious belief, has no motive for zeal in the
propagation of religion. We preach because we
believe. Let the idea, that the Christianity of Christ
or of Paul or of the New Testament needs modification,
become prevalent in the professing church,
and the secret of every true impulse in missionary
work, whether abroad or at home, will be gone. It
is the men who share Paul&rsquo;s stable, grand faith
who can take their stand as the preachers of Christ.
It is only they who can rise to the sacrifices
necessary for the promotion of His truth in the
world.</p>

<p>Have we such a faith as this? If not how can
we obtain it? This latter question will be best
answered by a close adherence to the text. We
must say a few words respecting the faith itself,
and also respecting Christ, who is the object of it.</p>

<p>What is faith? A common answer is that faith
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
is an act of intellectual submission to the teachings
of another&mdash;that it is in matters of the mind what
blind and unquestioning obedience is in matters of
practice. This account of faith was early imposed
by the Papal Church, and it is not repudiated even
now by some evangelical churches. The root of
all doctrines of sacramental efficacy is the renunciation
of private judgment in matters of faith.
No wonder that with such a definition of faith
Christianity should be held in derision, and regarded
as the special privilege of the young, the immature,
the aged, and all whose weaknesses and
disappointments leave them no other consolation
and no other resource! This is not the teaching of
Scripture. Of course in faith there is submission,
for there are many things to be believed which we
cannot understand. Nevertheless, faith is much
more than submission, and there is not a case of faith
in the whole Word of God which presents to us the
believing life as a thing of mere blind credulity.
Was it so with Abraham, with Job, with David,
with Paul, or with any of the others? Even in
relation to the dark things, faith rests upon convictions
which make submission the only rational,
the only possible attitude of the mind. According
to Scripture, faith is the soul laying hold of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
invisible God&mdash;laying hold of Christ as His Son and
our Saviour. There is no abdication of any one of
the powers of the soul. In believing, the soul is
entire with its reason, its thought, its love, and all
its spiritual energies. Nor is there any weakness.
When a man is hesitating between surrender to
the voice of conscience, and surrender to the voice
of passion, he performs an act of faith if he yields
to the voice of conscience, for he is ruled by the
invisible; yet the last thing we dare say of such a
man would be that he is weak. Rightly considered,
every such act is a triumph of the soul.
The conscientious man is the representative of the
greatest moral strength we know. Imagine a soul
with all its life under the constant thought of God
and of Christ. Surely such an order of life as his
affords scope enough for intellectual strength and
for moral heroism.</p>

<p>Much must be taken for granted, we said.
Reason has its sphere, and to it a truly noble task
is assigned. The visible world belongs to it, and
it is subjecting that world to itself more and more
every day. But how powerless it is when man
asks of it a response to the aspirations of his conscience
and his heart. What can it say to a soul
weighed down by a sense of guilt? What to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
heart that is torn by calamity? What to any man
when death draws nigh? Oh, no! Unless we
are to abandon ourselves to despair, there must
be faith&mdash;some truth in which, or some Being
in whom, the whole soul can repose. And mark,
this was just the light in which the apostle
looked at the matter. He was near the end.
Eternity was close before him. He knew that
endless issues were at stake. He was nerved to
confront it all by faith. <em>What faith?</em> What was
he trusting in?</p>

<p><em>Paul believed in Christ.</em> On what grounds? Can
<em>we</em> believe in Christ? If so, again I ask on what
grounds?</p>

<p>1. Christ stands before us in our darkness in
a position which is exclusively His own. Of all
men, He alone knew whence He came and whither
He went. Without hesitation, and with tones of
sovereign authority, He points out to us the way
to God. He speaks of heaven as one who has
come from thence. Everywhere He calls Himself
the Sent of the Father, His only-begotten Son, the
Lord of souls. His word was with power; sweet
with intensest human tenderness, influential with
Divine authority. What was it that gave Him
this power? Not human reasoning, not eloquence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
It was the light of Truth reaching the conscience,
and penetrating the heart. We see in Him God
as He is, and we also see in Him man as he ought
to be. We do not reason about this influence.
Apprehending Him, we instinctively accept it. It
is thus that millions have said: &ldquo;To whom can
we go but unto Thee? Thou hast the words of
eternal life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. This influence of Christ has been exerted
on every variety of human soul. His followers,
in ever-increasing numbers, come from all conditions
on earth&mdash;rich and poor, learned and ignorant,
young and old, hardened sinners and men blushing
with their first sins: all find from Him peace and
light and hope. Especially is this so with those
who suffer and weep; those who have felt the
poverty of mere words, and who are now beyond
the reach of any illusion. For the first time they
have been comforted, and the comfort has satisfied
them.</p>

<p>3. Still we want further to know by what
authority He wields this influence. We ask,
&ldquo;Does He come from God?&rdquo; The reply is that
He does before our eyes the works of God. Not
miracles merely, for though these constitute a
powerful testimony, there is yet something more.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
He has revealed God in His own person, and the
proof of His Divine mission has been given in His
life. In Him, holiness has been at once realised
and exhibited. Eighteen hundred years ago His
enemies could find no fault in Him. Since then
humanity has progressed, but Christ still leaves
the noblest sons of men amazingly far behind Him.
A hostile criticism has been indefatigable in its
attempt to discover flaws in His character, and
yet that character still stands before us as the
ideal of the good and the true. His is a holiness
before which the conscience of the world is accused
and judged. Irresistibly the answer of the heart
comes: &ldquo;He who is so holy must be worthy of all
our faith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>4. Moreover, there is the sense of sin and of
the need of pardon and salvation. Here after all,
and more than anywhere else, is the secret of
confidence in Christ. We seek salvation in works&mdash;anywhere
out of Him&mdash;but we cannot find it.
He who is holy and true tells us that He came
into the world to save us, that He is our sacrifice
and our peace, and that the love and the righteousness
of God are manifest in Him and in the
redeeming work He has undertaken on our behalf.
This exactly meets our case. We say: &ldquo;This is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
what we want, but what we have elsewhere sought
in vain. At His hands we accept it with implicit
trust and with fervent thankfulness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Are not these reasons enough? Is not the
response of every heart, &ldquo;Yes, they are.&rdquo; Can it
be less than the utmost folly and guilt for men to
resist the voice of a conscience which tells them
that it is only in Christ that the soul can find its
rest? Is all this concurrent testimony to be set
aside?</p>

<p>This assurance of faith, however, can only be
the result of intense earnestness. We do not
forget the necessity of the agency of the Spirit
of God; let us never forget it; but let us also
remember how constantly and how fatally that
agency can be contravened. Paul held the great
truths he preached with so tenacious and so
unquestioning a faith, because he had begun by
consecrating his heart to them under the intuitive
perception that they were the truths which his
nature as a man and his condition as a sinner so
imperatively needed, and because all his experience
of them did but confirm their sufficiency. &ldquo;If any
man will do the will of God, he shall know of the
doctrine whether it be of God,&rdquo; or whether it be of
men. &ldquo;I know whom I have believed, and am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
persuaded that He is able to keep that which I
have committed unto Him against that day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the unbeliever there are grounds enough for
faith, both within and without. And if, even with
the desire, faith be still found to be beset with
difficulties, there is one unfailing prayer which will
make it easy&mdash;the prayer, &ldquo;Lord, I believe; help
Thou mine unbelief.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><span class="smlfont">XVII.</span><br />
<i>IMMORTALITY.</i></h2>

<p class="theme">&ldquo;What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? and the son
of man, that Thou visitest him?&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm</span> viii. 4.</p>


<p>One or two remarks on the meaning of certain
expressions in this Psalm are necessary before we
proceed. The second verse is pictorial, and has a
martial character. Two hosts are seen facing each
other. A beautiful world and a wonderful universe
are in view of both. Children, in their conscious
or unconscious admiration of what they see, and
in the early and universal instinct by which they
attribute it to the hand of a great God, effectually
rebuke the unbelief of scoffers and all haters of
God, who persistently refuse to recognise Him in
His works. So, even to-day, the simple and pious
intuitions of the race face, fight, and conquer all
materialism. The beautiful and significant application
of these words found in the account of our
Lord&rsquo;s triumphal entry into Jerusalem points for
all time to the duty of giving Christian teaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
to the young. In our Christian homes and our
Sunday-schools lies the great bulwark against
the spread of infidelity. Such teaching acts on
the future. &ldquo;Instead of the fathers shall be the
children,&rdquo; a generation to serve God. These will
become fathers in their turn. &ldquo;Take care of the
children, and the adults will take care of themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?
and the son of man, that Thou visitest him?&rdquo; At
first sight, it would seem as though the Psalmist
were contrasting the littleness of man with the
greatness of the universe. And, indeed, he does
use a word to denote man which points to his
weakness. But this is only David&rsquo;s starting-point
in his aim to correct the impression. The Psalm
reveals, not the littleness, but the greatness of
man. &ldquo;When I consider Thy heavens, the work
of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which
Thou hast ordained; what is man, that Thou art
mindful of him? and the son of man, that Thou
visitest him?&rdquo; How little he looks! Yet how
great he must be! &ldquo;For Thou makest him to
want little of a Divine standing; Thou crownest
him with honour and glory; Thou makest him to
have dominion over the work of Thy hands; Thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
puttest all under his feet&mdash;all sheep and oxen, and
also beasts of the field, the fowl of the air, and the
fish of the sea&mdash;whatsoever passeth through the
paths of the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the subtlest, and, to a certain degree, one
of the most plausible of the objections of unbelief
has been the attempt to instil into men&rsquo;s minds
the idea that it is presumptuous on their part
to put confidence in the apparently sublime, but
really fallacious, prospects which Christianity offers
to them with regard to their destiny beyond this
world. God is too great, it is said, and man is too
little for us to admit the thought that God takes
such an interest in man, both for this world and
for the next, as the Bible affirms. The tendency of
modern thought is largely in the direction of this
view.</p>

<p>It would be easy to overtax our attention by
going into too wide a field. I will speak only of
the Christian idea of an immortal and heavenly
life hereafter. It is this which is imperilled; it
is this which is called in question. I have nothing
to do now with the debated question of future
punishment. Let me re-state the form of scepticism
with which I have to deal. It is said to be
presumptuous to suppose that we, the creatures of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
a day, are to be hereafter lifted up to a state of
perfect blessedness, which is to last for ever, in
the presence of God; and we are recommended to
leave this dream aside, and to be content with the
position we occupy here and now. &ldquo;You have
much to be thankful for, even as things are. Let
it not be thought a hardship, if death should prove
to be the end of man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lines of thought as they start from this
point are numerous, and one is tempted to follow
them out. But we must forbear, for the sake of
attending simply to our one purpose. I may,
however, point out to you how partial and unreal
is the view which is thus taken of man&rsquo;s position
and of his aspirations. Given the utmost of outward
and present satisfaction, man universally is
not content with this. But how many millions
of human beings there are in the world at this
moment to whom the present life can scarcely
be said to have been any boon at all! How many
more millions of such beings have lived in the
past. The very ground we tread everywhere
cowers beneath human sorrow. Is it not a cruel
mockery to say to the suffering, the enslaved, the
down-trodden: &ldquo;Be grateful for what you have; it
is vain, foolish, wrong for you to expect or to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
wish for more&rdquo;? Some such advice as this may be
given if our Christian hopes are tenable; but if
they are not, we do but insult the suffering if we
speak to them in this fashion.</p>

<p>The kind of unbelief we are anxious to check
is spreading. Among the masses, in many directions,
the desire to apprehend spiritual realities,
and to be ruled by them, is increasingly small;
the battles of life and thought are on behalf of
the interests of a day; and even among well-disposed
persons the hold of fundamental truth
is seriously relaxed. Hence the necessity for our
seeking to strengthen our cherished convictions,
and to discern clearly and grasp firmly &ldquo;the faith
once delivered to the saints.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the views we animadvert upon were entertained
merely by the ignorant and the uncultured,
we should not so much wonder; but we <em>are</em>
perplexed when we find them so prevalent amongst
the wise of this world, and even by not a few who
are reputed to be masters of human science. It
is true that their advancing knowledge gives them
vaster conceptions of the universe which they so
unweariedly explore; but is it not strange that
that vaster knowledge does not enhance their
estimate of man, since he <em>can</em> explore so widely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
and <em>can</em> comprehend so much? Why should religious
faith decrease in proportion as human knowledge
is accumulated?</p>

<p>I take the psalm before us as furnishing a
triumphant and lasting reply to the kind of unbelief
in question. In Nature, first, God shows us His
estimate of man. The ascent is easy from Nature
to Grace, in which the Divine estimate is raised to
its highest point.</p>

<p>We are invited to look around. Can there be any
doubt that this beautiful world, with its immense
treasures known and unknown, its bountiful harvests
of every order on land and sea, and its marvellous
variety of life, animate and inanimate, was
formed for our sakes? Was not everything the
earth contains made for our use and enjoyment,
in measure increasing with every new discovery?
The fruits of the ground, with each returning
season, are prepared for our wants, and in that
preparation, every season, with its sunshine and
its shade, its dryness and its rain, its dews and
its storms, is incessantly engaged. All nature is
occupied in the successful attempt to answer the
initial question, &ldquo;What shall we eat? what shall
we drink? and wherewithal shall we be clothed?&rdquo;
The dress we wear brings innumerable animals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
under tribute. &ldquo;We have dominion over all sheep
and oxen, yea, and the beast of the field, the fowl
of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever
passeth through the paths of the sea.&rdquo; Everything
tells us that, in this world, we are kings&mdash;&ldquo;a
little,&rdquo; only a little, &ldquo;lower than the angels&rdquo;&mdash;the
gods. Between man and the inferior animals
there is as great a distance as between the master
and his slave;&mdash;nay more, as between the artizan
and his instruments. The irrational animal is
much nearer to the inanimate creation than to man
since the end and purpose of both is to minister
to man. This world, therefore, was manifestly
made for us. Who ventures to doubt it? Least
of all can it be doubted by the discoverers of earth&rsquo;s
profounder secrets.</p>

<p>We are invited to look still further afield. This
world, which is made for us, is not independent or
alone. It is in no sense self-sustained. It is part
of a wonderful and incomprehensible whole. Other
great creations concur in its maintenance. The
sun enlightens, warms, and fertilizes it. The
moon and the stars exert manifold influences upon
it. The whole host of heaven has been brought
into co-ordinate and helpful relation to it&mdash;yes, <em>it</em>:
the world which exists <em>for us</em>! &ldquo;When I consider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon
and the stars which Thou hast ordained;&rdquo; when I
consider the manifold bearings of Thy universe
upon man&mdash;what <em>is</em> man! What <em>must</em> he be! In
certain aspects, indeed, apparently small; but, by
all these tokens, how great! We do not say that
we are the only moral and spiritual beings in the
midst of so many worlds. We do not know, but
we may accept the probability that God has created
beings capable of adoring and loving Him everywhere.
But we do say&mdash;and science combines
with Scripture to compel us to say&mdash;that these
worlds have been in part created for us, just as our
world has been in part created for them. This is
clear. The most sceptical of men cannot venture
to doubt it; nor do they. It is only needful that
we should carefully observe in order to become
convinced of this marvellous fact.</p>

<p>So much, then, for what nature teaches. The
psalmist sought to learn the lesson, and it is right
that we should seek to learn it too.</p>

<p>This first step being taken, another follows.
Man is an object of the manifold agencies of
myriads of worlds. He is so <em>as man</em>; and the
relative position he holds, intellectually, morally,
or socially, to his fellow men, has nothing to do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
with the fact. Nature ministers to the Caffre and
the Hottentot as truly as to the man of most advanced
civilization; the only difference being in
the use which the two opposite classes can make
of nature. Why, then, should man refuse to
believe that he is an object of solicitous love to
that God who created him, who made him what
he is, and who thus crowned him with glory and
honour? Why should he refuse to believe that
God loves him enough to send His Son to die for
him, and thus to save him from the wreck of his
being through sin? Especially, why should he
refuse to believe this when he is assured of it by
Him who testified that He was that Son of God&mdash;by
Jesus, the man <em>par excellence</em>, the God-man?
Why should it be doubted that man is an object of
interest to angels, who are said to rejoice over
every sinner that repenteth? Why should it be
doubted that God has provided for him a fairer
home than this, that immortality and heaven are
the things which God has in reserve for him?
Why should it be doubted that an everlasting salvation
has been provided for him through such a
sacrifice as that of Christ? If sun, moon, and
stars have been made for the service of man, why
should it be hard to believe that God, who counts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
the stars, and calls them all by their names, should
also heal the broken in heart, and bind up their
wounds?</p>

<p>The prospect of human destiny as opened up
by Christianity is grand; but not too grand to be
ascribed to Him who created the universe, and
so arranged it that it should constitute one vast
system of ministration to us. When we see God
thus working for man, we cannot be surprised that
angels should be glad to serve him too. Neither
can we wonder that the Son of God should come
to save him. The wonder begins with man&rsquo;s primary
relation to the &ldquo;all things,&rdquo; for our knowledge
of which we are not dependent upon revelation at
all. Science teaches us that; and revelation only
endorses it. That is wonderful enough; but accepting
it as a fact, all that revelation teaches, but
which science could not have discovered, follows
naturally enough. The facts of revelation concerning
man may be accepted the more implicitly
because they really have their basis in the facts of
science. The whole is in perfect harmony. The
one and the other are both represented&mdash;and consistently
so&mdash;as concurring in the great cause of
human happiness.</p>

<p>Try now from the greatness of the means to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
estimate the greatness of the end. Is eternal life too
much for a being whom the worlds combine to
sustain, to feed, and to bless? Is a heaven of
holiness and of love too much for a being whom
angels are delighted to protect? No! The wonderful
thing would be if, after having combined
these vast and various forces to maintain our
earthly existence, an Almighty and All-good God
should for ever quench our life after its brief day
upon the earth!</p>

<p>It may be objected that this is a low and selfish
view to take of the matter. It may be said that it
is not the life of the individual, but the life of the
race that has to be considered; and that it is
enough for us to live, after we are gone, in the
good remembrances of those who will survive us,
and to hope that what we are doing will advance
the interests of those who will follow us. An immortality
such as this is in reality no immortality
at all. An unconscious immortality! A public
recognition of what we have been when we shall
be no longer! A public gratitude, which may at
best be but precarious to those to whom it is due,
when they are believed to have dropped into nothingness
and thus to be no longer capable of
receiving and enjoying it! A progress merely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
confined to material interests! And who are sharing
in it to-day? The few who are strong enough to
hold their own in the battle of life! They, and only
they! All this is supreme nonsense. The aspirations
of the heart are against it. If man&rsquo;s life
ends here, it was not worth while for him to be
born. Millions, in that case, might justly look up
to God and say, &ldquo;Remember how short my time
is: wherefore hast Thou made all men in vain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, lest we should be exalted to pride
and self-importance, let us remember that the
grandeur of our destiny is not determined and
measured by our merits, but by the immensity of
the Divine goodness. What have we which we
have not received? And since we have received
it, why should we boast as if it were all of our own
making?</p>

<p>Ah, it is because Satan can compare our hopes
with our rights, and can help us to do so too, that
he succeeds in injecting doubts into our hearts.
Our reply must be, that the eternal and blessed
life which we anticipate is not of <em>reward</em>, but of
<em>grace</em>; not a payment, but a gift&mdash;a gift in harmony
with all God&rsquo;s other gifts, but still the greatest gift
of all; and that instead of inflating us with pride, it
may well place us at His feet in lowliest, devoutest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
thankfulness. By sin we had forfeited all; but
&ldquo;where sin hath abounded, grace doth much
more abound.&rdquo; God loved the man whom He had
created with such power, and whom He had
placed in so commanding a position; and because
He loved him, He resolved to provide a great
redemption for him.</p>

<p>What a ground have we here for hope! And
what a plea for evangelisation!</p>

<h2><span class="smlfont">XVIII.</span><br />
<i>HEAVEN.</i></h2>

<p class="theme">&ldquo;Therefore are they before the throne of God.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Revelation</span>
vii. 15.</p>


<p>Let us think of Heaven this morning. The verses
of which the text is a fragment will help us to do
so.</p>

<p>The hope of heaven is the crowning hope of the
Christian. It ought at all times to be an important
element in his joy. All the pleasant things of
earth should be made brighter by the reflected
light of the world beyond the grave. It is common,
however, for us to live in a sort of unconsciousness
of this. Within proper limits this is not to be
complained of. For our duties are <em>here</em>, and we
are not fitted for there by &ldquo;looking too eagerly
beyond.&rdquo; Besides, earth is the training-school for
heaven, and unless we would enter into heaven as
into &ldquo;a vast abrupt,&rdquo; obviously our present duty
is by all means to cultivate that life which shall
fit us for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
There are, however, certain lulls in the rush of
life which seem to draw us to the contemplation
of the future. We find them sometimes in seasons
of repose, but more especially in seasons of sorrow,
and more especially still in seasons of bereavement.</p>

<p>I am not anxious to form an argument this
morning. I have little disposition to <em>argue</em> about
heaven. But I want to express some thoughts,
disjointed perhaps, but I trust suggestive, and
each one carrying its message to our weary hearts.</p>

<p>What may we know? We often ask this
question with hope that is tremulous&mdash;or it may
be with tremulousness that is hopeful. What
may we know? Certainly not all that we sometimes
wish to know; but then we sometimes wish
to know things the knowledge of which would be
useless, or curious, or beyond our reach until we
can see with tearless eyes, and realise with sinless
hearts. There are certain aspects under which
heaven seems to be altogether visionary. Where
is it? We are not told. What are the dimensions
and outlines of it? We do not know. It is
described under a great variety of material figures.
We read of its gates of pearl, its walls of jasper,
its streets of gold, its river of the water of life, its
tree of life; but we know that these descriptions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
symbolise the spiritual. Not that they are mere
riddles, however. Some of their truth may be
confidently guessed. There is one important fact
of which we cannot be in doubt. Heaven is the
place in which will be developed and perfected a
certain character&mdash;certain moral and spiritual
qualifications. Heaven is where perfect goodness
is, just as on earth happiness is where godliness
and Christlikeness are. We may, therefore, put
heaven where we will, and think about it almost
as we please, provided we put the right sort of
character there, and remember what sort of discipline
here must prepare for it. This is the essential
point in the revelations of this book: &ldquo;There shall
in no wise enter into it anything that defileth,
neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or
maketh a lie: but they which are written in the
Lamb&rsquo;s book of life.&rdquo; There <em>must</em> be a heaven
for the good.</p>

<p>I shall not stop to point out what a wreck our
common Christianity would be if there were no
future life of blessedness for the Christian. In
contemplating such a possibility, the apostle Paul
exclaims: &ldquo;If in this life only we have hope in
Christ, we are of all men most miserable.&rdquo; <em>We</em>:
for we have expected heaven; the fair vision has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
been put before us as a great hope, and we lose in
proportion to what we thought we had gained.
<em>We</em>: for we have prepared for it, through a life&mdash;in
many instances a <em>long</em> life&mdash;of self discipline, of
loyalty to God, of the mortification of sin, of the
cultivation of goodness. <em>We</em>: for we have suffered
for it, sometimes directly through ills endured for
Christ&rsquo;s sake, and always indirectly by the sacrifice
of that which the world distinctively calls its own,
and on which it sets its supreme regard. Our
Christianity has promised this heaven to us; and
the promise has enhanced many an earthly joy,
and charmed away many an earthly sorrow. No
heaven? Then we have been shamefully deceived&mdash;miserably
disappointed; and there is no hope for
us any more! But no! The words of the great
consolation are sounding still, and we can trust
them: &ldquo;Let not your heart be troubled: ye
believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father&rsquo;s
house are many mansions: <em>if it were not so, I
would have told you</em>. I go to prepare a place for
you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will
come again, and receive you unto myself; that
where I am there ye may be also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is one of the characteristic glories of the
Bible that it meets the renewed heart&rsquo;s desires in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
regard to the future, by revealing, not only the fact
of the future, but also some of its resplendent
mysteries; so that, after taking man through the
several stages of his progress on earth, it conducts
him at last to the heaven of his hopes, the home
of the good. Perhaps no Scripture disclosure of
Heaven is more wonderful, more complete, more
entrancing than the one we have in the vision of
the apostle John as recorded in the verses before
us. True, it is put before us, like the other revelations
of this book, in poetical and pictorial form.
Nevertheless, the spiritual teaching is sufficiently
plain. Let us seek the help of that good Spirit by
whom John was inspired, whilst we try to learn
something of that which is revealed to us in this
chapter. In the light of it we see an innumerable
multitude of persons who, having travelled this
world in trial and in sorrow, are now before the
throne of God, safe in the heaven of the
redeemed.</p>

<p>So we see, at the very beginning, that the
Heaven which is here presented to our view is no
solitary place. It is not peopled merely by a few.
John says he saw &ldquo;a great multitude whom no
man could number.&rdquo; In the Old Testament a
similar phrase is used to denote Israel, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
representative of the Church of later times. The numberless
stars of heaven, and the sands on the seashore
are the parallels of the idea we find here.
The Church on earth, sometimes not unfitly described
as &ldquo;a garden walled around,&rdquo; and as &ldquo;a
little flock,&rdquo; is not, in this sense, the representation
of the Church in heaven. We see, further, that
the heavenly territory embraces the representatives
of every earthly human condition: they gather from
all ages and all climes of the world&mdash;from all &ldquo;nations
and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues.&rdquo; In
this great fact we have the basis of the theory of our
mission work, and our hope of its ultimate success.</p>

<p>We see, again, that the relation of the saints to
Christ in heaven is essentially the same as that of
the saints on earth. They stand before the throne
and before the Lamb, and cry with a loud voice:
&ldquo;Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the
throne, and unto the Lamb.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="cpoem23">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They sing the Lamb in hymns above,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And we in hymns below.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Self-confidence, self-righteousness, self-exaltation
have no place <em>there</em>. All the glory of salvation,
all the glory of heaven, is due to God and to the
Lamb from first to last. Every step of the way,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
right on to its termination, has been arranged by
His wisdom and accomplished by His grace.</p>

<p>With these facts before us, there ought to be no
strangeness connected with our conception of
Heaven. Its inhabitants are our friends transferred,
and the elements of its perfected life and
joy are the same as we are, in our measure, familiar
with in the imperfect state through which we
are now passing. Perhaps the most comprehensive,
and most spiritually attractive and influential
idea of it is that of <em>entire satisfaction</em>. In
this aspect of it, it meets the demands of our
experience, fulfils our hope, and draws us upward.
Satisfaction! How beautiful the thought! To
the weary and the heavy laden it comes as rest.
To the aspiring it comes as a sphere of boundless
opportunity. To the sad and troubled, it is &ldquo;a
land of pure delight.&rdquo; To those who groan under
present spiritual short comings and frailties, it is the
home of the spirits of the just made perfect. We are
often staggered at the faults of Christians; they
will be &ldquo;without fault&rdquo; there. Here our faults
dissociate us more or less from our brethren;
faultlessness there will make the union complete.
Here darkness, there light; here sowing, there the
harvest; here a wilderness, there the garden of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
the Lord. Heaven contains all our ideals of the
true, the beautiful and the good; and one day we
shall realise them! The description which we
have before us warrants all this, and much more.
How much more? The redeemed in Heaven live
a life of immunity from suffering. No hunger; no
thirst; no oppression from the heat of the sun.
No faintness; no pangs. John seems, from the
form of expression he uses, to have beheld them
as they were &ldquo;coming out of great tribulation.&rdquo;
Whatever may be the prophetic reference in these
words, we may understand them as having some
meaning appropriate to all the redeemed. All life,
with its varied experience may be called (and that
too in no fanciful sense) a tribulation; in this
sense at least, that it is a probation, a trial, a
testing-time in view of the great awards of the
future. From this all come, gradually, successively,
one by one, passing from the school of
earth to the home of heaven. Trial is the
common discipline of the good, and it comes in
many forms;&mdash;sometimes in the form of bodily
pain and sickness; sometimes in the form of
trouble, disappointment, loss in the household and
in the social circle; sometimes in the form of
persecution; often in the form of a struggle with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
temptation springing up from within or from without;
often, it may be, in the form of conflict with
doubt. Sorrow, trial, tribulation&mdash;from all this
the redeemed in heaven have emerged. But they
have not only escaped from evil; they have risen
into a perfect blessedness&mdash;the blessedness which
comes from the satisfaction of every want. They
not only hunger no more, neither thirst any more;
but the Lamb that is in the midst of the throne
feeds them, and leads them to living fountains of
waters. Their blessedness is all the richer because
not only are all their tears wiped away, but wiped
away by the hand of infinite gentleness and love&mdash;the
hand of the Best Beloved in all the universe!
Well may they be glad! Well may they sing
loud ecstatic songs of praise to their Redeemer.
Well may they serve Him day and night in His
temple&mdash;perfected powers rejoicing evermore in a
perfect consecration. They are a company living,
dwelling, at the very centre of joy: no care
upon them, no labour weighing them down; their
Lord in the midst of them, their satisfaction
complete.</p>

<p>The contrast between their condition on earth
and in heaven is full of wonder to us as we muse
upon it. How was the change wrought? What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244]</a></span>
must we learn concerning this from what is here
revealed?</p>

<p>They were prepared <em>here</em> for the state beyond.
The life of heaven is the continuation and the
result of the earthly life. &ldquo;They washed their
robes and made them white in the blood of the
Lamb,&rdquo; and they &ldquo;came up out of great tribulation.&rdquo;
Here we have the process of the cleansing,
&ldquo;the great tribulation&rdquo; being comprehensive of
the whole discipline by which God purifies human
souls. Here we have also the purifying element,
&ldquo;the blood of the Lamb,&rdquo; the atoning power to
wash out all stains, the stimulating power to inspire
to all holiness. And we also have the final
result&mdash;&ldquo;white raiment.&rdquo; So, doctrinally, the
&ldquo;robes&rdquo; stand for the whole character, the tribulation
for the process of purification; &ldquo;the blood of
the Lamb,&rdquo; for the cleansing element in its justifying
and sanctifying effects. Their holiness is not
merely passive. There is a righteousness which is
imputed; but there is also a righteousness which
is acquired&mdash;acquired in the might of the Saviour,
and through the influences of His Spirit. Those
who do not aspire to the latter have no hope from
the former, except a hope which must make them
ashamed. But inasmuch as both aspects of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
salvation are to be referred to the Lamb, they give to
Him the glory. It is all His from beginning to
end. &ldquo;They have washed their robes and made
them white in the blood of the Lamb.&rdquo; Thus their
salvation was effected on earth. Heaven has introduced
no new moral element into their condition.
Heaven is essentially the full realisation of what a
Christian expects and hopes this side the grave.
It is the inheritance of the man who has the kingdom
of God <em>within</em> him.</p>

<p>There is one part of the description which requires
a little explanation, and all the more so as
it bears upon the aspects given to us of heavenly
blessedness. The redeemed are represented as
standing before the throne with palms in their
hands. Many explain this by the heathen use of
the palm as the emblem of victory, and they quote
the declaration: &ldquo;In all these things we are more
than conquerors through Him that loved us.&rdquo; I
would rather, with some, refer this emblem to a
much sweeter and holier reminiscence. The figure
seems to be taken from the Feast of Tabernacles,
which commemorated two things&mdash;God&rsquo;s care for,
and protection of, Israel during their wanderings
in the wilderness, and His continued Providence
in the supply of the fruits of the earth in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
season. It was held at the close of the year&rsquo;s out-door
labours, and with it the season of rest began.
And so with the ransomed above, the troubles of
the wilderness are ended, and the harvest-home
has come.</p>

<p>Such is the heaven to which God has removed
our dead. May we not with thankfulness leave
them there? Must we not feel that by death, they
have made a glorious exchange? In their case,
it would be wrong to call death by hard names.
It is the message which comes to the child at
school to go home. I know that we often fail to
apprehend this. Bound by time and sense, we
want to build our homes here, and our structures
have one after another to be overthrown that we
may the better learn to think of &ldquo;the city which
hath foundations, whose builder and maker is
God.&rdquo; Heaven is best seen by the graves of those
we have loved; and not till earth becomes poor to
us is Heaven felt to be rich. There our loved ones
are in raiment white and clean, and they are happy.
Let it be our constant endeavour to rejoin them
there. The same blood still atones; the same all-holy
Spirit still purifies; the same process of trial
leads to the same issue. For ourselves, we should
ever keep in mind the connection between discipline
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
here and glory hereafter. Present darkness may
be interpreted by future light. Even now, the
sanctified effects of trial are such as to suggest to
us what its final issues will be. It subdues us,
makes us gentle, reveals us to ourselves, reveals
God to us, spiritualises us; so that we may well
be more anxious to have our troubles blessed by
God than to have them taken away. As the discipline
of earth is fashioning us for heaven, so our
conceptions of heaven are continually re-acting
upon us, and moulding our life.</p>

<p>One thought more. The seer beholds the immense
multitude of the redeemed. The angel
asks him who they are; but he does not know
them. Many of them perhaps are persons whom
he had known on earth; but they are so changed
that he does not recognise them now. He used
to know them by their imperfect Christian virtues;
but now they are &ldquo;without fault.&rdquo; And so they
seem strange to him, just as sometimes even here
the transformations of virtue and of joy make us
say of well-known faces that we hardly recognise
them again. A hint of this we often see in the
faces of the dead; so like, yet so unlike. Is there
any doubt, then, as to our recognising them at the
last? None. We may, perhaps, fail to identify
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
them at once, but they will not be strangers to us
long. We shall look upon them with opened and
purified eyes, and shall know them, even as the
disciples on the mount knew Moses and Elias,
notwithstanding the glory. Oh, it will be good
for us to be there! Good for us to remain there
for ever!</p>

<p>Read: &ldquo;These are they who <em>are coming</em>&rdquo;&mdash;not
&ldquo;who came.&rdquo; They began to come with Abel;
and the procession is not yet closed. Among the
last are those over the loss of whom we are weeping
now. Let us brush away our tears; for at
least we may say to ourselves this&mdash;</p>
